       "['We had a great stay! The location was convenient to everything! We found a great place for breakfast nearby (Yolk). The corner king room had a great view. Staff was excellent- Michelle was great and so helpful. When we come back, we will stay here again.',\n",
       " 'My parents came to this hotel in August because I was having a family reunion at home and it was too small to accommodate them, I would like to thank the staff for their kindness and for having met the expectations of my parents, they loved their stay with you, beautiful room with all the comfort they needed, excellent breakfast, thank you',\n",
       " 'The staff was amazing and offered such great advice on tours and food options.  The hotel is perfectly located for a lot of walking options.  A ton of wonderful restaurants within a block or two.  Shopping was close by as well.  The only drawback and it’s minor, which comes from my builder husband, was they should fix the poor job of wallpapering in the bathroom.  Too late to fix, but may we suggest doing it over with a better company.  They did not do your hotel justice.  It’s evident in other areas the upgrades were spared no expense.  Just a suggestion.  By no means would this keep us from coming back!',\n",
       " 'We stayed at the kinzie this past weekend and we were greeted by Arturo Garza. He was one the the most genuine and nicest person I’ve yet encounter at a hotel. He was extremely helpful with local restaurants, things to do, and even suggested a few of his favorite spots to visit. This experience made my stay more enjoyable and I was more welcomed into the city. Thank you for everything Arturo!  Highly recommend',\n",
       " 'The staff was very welcoming from walking through the doors. The suite, omg, the pictures are nothing compared. It was beautiful and we will definitely be back. Thank you for the hospitality and the breakfast',\n",
       " 'It was the first time my friends and I stayed at the Kinzie Hotel and we were so happy Arturo took such good care of us. Arturo made our check-in process very easy and was cheerful through out the whole process. He also explained to us about the Happy Hour the hotel offers, and he brought us some cute little wine bottles we had picked from the variety he offered from. Arturo made us feel delighted when we were around him, very nice hotel and excellent service!  Definitely coming back soon! ',\n",
       " 'I had the pleasure of staying at the Kinzie hotel while waiting on my apartment to be ready. I would like to say the front desk guy Nico was soo pleasant and amazing. He accommodated next with everything i needed, everytime i entered he gave me a warm welcome and a sense of feeling wanted.. Also there was a very nice young lady with curly hair who assisted me when i needed to extent my trip an extra day. Overall everything was perfect, clean, and neat. Will visit again one day and you can thank Nico and the nice lady with curly hair(sorry forgot your name) at the desk.',\n",
       " 'We were very pleased with our stay at the Hotel. Theas very cozy, clean and comfortable. We truly enjoyed the large tube, only wishing the shower had an attachment because of my height 😊. The staff Arturo Garza was very, professional, friendly, engaging and patient, he really made feel welcome. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to all my friends and family.',\n",
       " 'Great Hotel in the middle of Everything, Great Rooms, ( I had a suite), it was one of the best views of the city , I have ever had, Great , Great , Great.Walking Distance to Great Restaurants and Shopping. Evening Reception with Free , yes I said Free Wine was Great.',\n",
       " 'This would be a nice hotel if it were 3 stars, but rating it as a four star hotel is unrealistic.  Our room was had mold on growing on ceiling.  The walls were banged up.  It’s definitely in need of some repairs.  The location is fabulous.  The staff were kind and courteous.  However there wasn’t enough staff.  With only one staff member, there was a long wait to check in on a Monday afternoon.  The wait to get my car was even longer the next day, at least 20 minutes.  Over $70 a day to park and with such a long wait, we should have just parked it ourselves.  The city view should be called a street view, as the building is so much lower than the others you don’t see much except for the street below and 1-2 buildings.  It’s not a bad place, just not a great place either.  ',\n",
       " 'Everything was perfect, nice staff, great view, great location, TV had Netflix. Great restaurants we’re in walking distance, close walk to a great mall, navy pier was close as well. Really peaceful stay and me and the wife definitely will be back soon',\n",
       " 'Great place to stay in downtown Chicago. Across from an iconic restaurant and near lake shore drive. The staff was excellent especially Michelle. She went over and above to make sure we were welcome and appreciated. Room was cool and clean. Thank you so much we will be back',\n",
       " 'The Hotel has an AWFUL customer service, I did my checkout and on my way to the airport I notice I forgot my Apple Watch and reported to a staff member Andrew who the only thing he did was send me link to report the item, which I did and attached a picture of the Find my iPhone show where it was and was easy to find because it receives calls, they refused to check the room while the Apple Watch still had battery, they notify me the next day that they did not find my watch. Let me tell you I’ve stay in not good looking room but staff more customer service related.  The watch disappear even with pictures of location during several hours and it can not be found. Shame. Besides that they only clean your room if you’re out before 8am, forget the experience of vacation waking up later',\n",
       " 'Wasn\\'t sure what to expect during this unusual summer, but this place was better than expected. We had a suite, with amazing windows floor to ceiling.  We checked in early a couple of hours without any hassle. Did not try the \"to go\"breakfast, but did enjoy the \"happy hour\" wine. Great location on a semi-quiet street. Easy walk to the Riverwalk, Michigan Ave, and Millenium Park. Also, the price for a suite was lower than a standard room at most of the other nice hotels in the area. Also, lady at front desk told us about \"spot hero\" app that saved us $50 on parking. Great deal!',\n",
       " 'Its really clean, modern and upscale. Its smaller so it feels like a nice boutique hotel, yet it feels like it has the standard of an amazing high end large hotel chain. I was also surprised that we had a view overlooking a really cool outdoor patio. Its right next to amazing upscale restaurants with outdoor patios. This is a good hotel for tourism, business or anything! They gave us big bottles of wine at check in so that was cool, too!',\n",
       " 'My friends and I took a quick trip to Chicago to celebrate my birthday! The Kinzie Hotel was the perfect hotel for all of our needs. The staff was very hospitable, helped my friends surprise me by hiding cake and Party needs. Our accommodations were perfect for our weekend away. We felt very safe and secure given the COVID19 life we all live now. The Kinzie Hotel provides services at your leisure while also reducing risk. Andrew the manager provided a great guide on how to enhance your stay while also feeling like your healthy and safety are priority! Oh & best of all the location is perfect for sight seeing, dining and outdoor experiences ! You won’t be disappointed! The rooms are clean , modern, and provide great Chicago views! Oh and they have a cool photo booth in the lobby',\n",
       " 'Amazing. The place was clean, the staff was prompt, the location was in the middle of everything that we needed to get to. I was very grateful for the working crew and positive energy that we were treated with.',\n",
       " 'I used to stay at another hotel in the area but it was full. I was getting tired of that place anyway because they were overcharging for what should be affordable rooms. I guess I had an Idea of what affordable looked like for near the Loop and expected the same sort of space from Kinzie because the price was close. The room at Kinzie exceeded these expectations; windows, amenities, coffee pods and robust WiFI, but also the desk staff treated me like I was some sort of VIP. The staff immediately read my situation when I arrived (tired, hungry, barely social or communicative) there was some sort of glitch with my reservation because I used an app that was being weird. They were bright and cheerful and made me feel comfortable as they quickly accommodated. I opted to pay for',\n",
       " 'We really enjoyed our stay in Chicago, even though it was for a short time. The Kinzie Hotel was very clean, had beautiful views, and great light cancelling shades. Michelle at the front desk was so helpful and welcoming! She is a gem of an employee!',\n",
       " 'My 35th bday. Amazing Staff Very Professional and Kind. Breakfast section is awesome and healthy choice. Will definitely repeat business here. Thanks Kinzie Hotel. Love the theme lobby as well. Great security after hours too.',\n",
       " \"My room was small but nice. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but I'll chalk that up to COVID-19 and social distancing.  I had a view of Kinzie Street as well as the Trump Hotel after I requested a high floor with a view. The staff was very friendly and informative, all except the valet which seem to take at least 30 mins and cost $73 a night which was almost the price of my room! That being said, I had a decent stay in downtown Chicago for a fairly low price!!\",\n",
       " 'This hotel accepted to cancel our reservation without fee due to the current sanitary situation while we had not booked with a cancellation facility. THANK YOU VERY MUCH Kinzie Hotel !! Next time in Chicago we visit you !',\n",
       " 'My friend booked a room at the Kinzie Hotel for business and decided to have me over for dinner. I went to the front desk to ask if there was water to purchase. Raul Villarreal was very helpful and even gave some recommendations for some things to visit in the area. All in all, his hospitality and warm smile made the stay even that much better. Thanks Raul!',\n",
       " 'I just want to take a minute and shout out Raul Villarreal! He was very accommodating and helpful at the front desk, when I had some specific questions about the area. Because of his hospitality alone, I’ll definitely consider rebooking at the Kinzie Hotel.',\n",
       " 'We have been trying out different boutique hotels in Chicago over the past year or so, and this was one of the nicest we’ve stayed at. We had a corner suite, and it was well laid out, furnished very nicely, floor to ceiling windows with electronic drapes, and very intimate and luxurious. The front desk staff here are stellar at their jobs, especially Lexy and Lupe!! They truly are two of the most friendly and welcoming desk staff I’ve encountered in many years of staying in hotels. Andrew, the GM, also was very welcoming and genuinely wanted our anniversary there to be special. The Kinzie Hotel truly is a “diamond in the rough”, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an intimate, well appointed boutique hotel, in a great location, in Chicago. Looking forward to',\n",
       " 'Family business required that my wife and I travel to Chicago for the weekend. In spite of the fact that the city is largely shut down, and the hotels that are open are very limited in terms of the amenities they can offer, the Kinzie was such a nice positive experience. Extremely friendly and accommodating staff, great rooms – wonderful floor to ceiling windows with a nice chaise lounge to sit and watch the city rest – great location, great vibe. We will definitely return!',\n",
       " 'Our stay at the Kinzie Hotel was absolutely perfect! From the moment we checked in, everything and everyone was incredible. A great location, an exceptionally clean room and friendly, helpful staff make this an obvious choice for anyone traveling to Chicago. Highly recommended!!!',\n",
       " \"We have stayed here a number of times when we come to town for Blackhawk games, the theater, or just to get away. The cost, the location, and the friendliness of the staff are exceptional (Mona and Derrick). If you are a walker, it is very easy to  walk to attractions both north and south. The continental breakfast is more than enough to send one out for the day, and the wine/beer in the evening is a plus. Then, too, the discount at the Public House next door is great for a drink or light meal. Parking fees are steep, but they can be reduced by using Spot Hero for nearby parking garages if you don't want to go in and out.\",\n",
       " \"We loved our stay st the Kinzie Hotel. Perfect location. Close walk to so much. Rooms are clean and spacious. Fun complimentary hour hour and breakfast. Especially great bellman Derrick in the morning and Alex in the evening. Highly recommend and we've found where we'll stay from now on!\",\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Kinzie hotel from March 2 through March 7. Martin, the hotel manager, went out of his way to accommodate us with our requested room. Service was outstanding from every employee; doorman, housekeeping, front desk, bartender, and even the maintenance person. Location couldn’t be better. I loved the layout of the room with a long desk bar in the bedroom and a full countertop in the bathroom (no lousy non-functional decorative pedestal sinks in this hotel). An empty refrigerator was available in the room, perfect for in room beverages. We’ve stayed here multiple times and look forward to returning. ',\n",
       " 'Cozy and stylish room! Appreciated the extra things offered in the room, especially for getting ready. LOVED the complimentary happy hour! The only thing I wasn’t a fan of was our view. 😕 Great location to restaurants, bars, music venues, and shopping!',\n",
       " \"I've traveled all over the world and stayed at some of the best hotels. I didn't know what to expect when I booked a room at Kinzie Hotel. Not only was my greeting upon arrival and check-in pleasant and easy, the room was modern, clean and pretty cool! Bathroom and fixtures were well done. Strong shower. Ordered room service and had one of the best salads of my life! I admired the pens in the room and upon checkout asked if I could have a couple...the fellow ran out and secured me a few to take with me. Great location and a great stay. I was pleasantly surprised and will recommend Kinzie Hotel to friends and family visiting me in Chicago.\",\n",
       " 'I very much enjoyed my stay at the Kinzie Hotel. From the \"informal\" lobby full of friendly staff to the generous rooms with lots of natural light, this hotel offers a great atmosphere. The continental breakfast and cocktail hour were much better than what is offered in more standard \"chain\" hotels. The location was convenient to meetings I had in the Loop, even walkable in some cases. I highly recommend this option and will definitely return!',\n",

Loved the complimentary breakfast and happy hour. Looking forward to returning in April, June, July and September!',\n",

Great room & Amazing amenities and Beautiful property. Amazing!! I booked the room close to a testing center I had exams at the following day and had a great night rest and was able to walk 5-7 mins to my exams. Thank you to the AWESOME Kinzie Staff for making my night stay WONDERFUL!',\n",
       " \"I went to Chicago for a short girls' trip with my two daughters and cousin.  I can't say enough about how we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Kinzie! We loved how it was so personal. The rooms were wonderful and we felt like the staff was really watching out for us. We felt very safe!  The location couldn't have been better. Located right in the middle of everything on the river downtown. So many things in walking distance. We walked to dinner and a super cool tiki bar the first night. Hit a ping-pong club the second. We would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone!\",\n",

The hotel staff were the most friendly amazing people and we will definitely be returning here in the future. This was my first visit but my sisters third, we loved Chicago.  Special thank you to Lexi who was an amazing help when our flight got cancelled, she was so patient and helped us deal with airline, rebook into hotel and also sorted our transfer back to airport. We are so grateful and hope to thank you in person some day.  All the staff were great, brilliant hotel, would',\n",

So close to Michigan Avenue for walking, and the staff could not be any nicer! This hotel was clean and the staff were so helpful when I had a problem with my reservation.

A great breakfast included in the room rate - cereals, porridge, muesli, yoghurts etc. And pastries, doughnuts, rolls, hard boiled eggs.  Coffee, tea etc. They still have the 2 hour happy hour period when you can have complimentary wines and beers in the lounge area - great!  The rooms are a fair size for city rooms - noticed a few scuffs on the walls this year.  Lovely comfortable big bed and complimentary toiletries.  Snacks for sale in the room.

The showers are quite narrow, so if that's an issue for you a room with a tub might be better. The location is very convenient to shopping along the Magnificent Mile.

We had a great view of the 360 tower from our room on the 25th floor. This is an ideal hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. The only downside I would add to this and it is minor was that the breakfast offering was a bit stingy for the price.

It has a good spacious lobby, where free hot drinks are served in the morning and Prosecco or mulled cider fo an hour early evening, sufficient (and beautiful art deco lifts) and reasonably sized rooms.

The property itself is gorgeous with a stunning chandelier in the lobby and modern decor.  My favorite room layout is the one bedroom, which feels more like an apartment than the loft.

       " \"My husband and I decided to visit for a  weekend getaway and chose the Ambassador. It was a great decision. We loved the location, convenient to restaurants and shopping in the Gold Coast. It's also right near the North end of Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile.   The staff were exceptionally warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. Everyone we met from the Bell Staff and Front Desk, to the bar and Housekeeping, they were all kind and hospitable.  The room was nice and the hotel has the charm of years past combined with modern amenities. We especially enjoyed the Keurig in the room and the bathroom toiletries.   We had drinks at the bar and grab and go breakfast in the Library, both were great. The drinks were delicious and the grab and go breakfast was ideal for a quick, tasty bite.\",\n",

I love the ambiance of the hotel, they have an amazing entrance lobby, library room and bar on the first floor.   The staff is exceptional- Kay always makes me feel welcome with her big smile and warm personality. Everyone is very attentive with their service. I cannot say enough good things about the staff.   I stay in Chicago often and would only stay here. I highly recommend this as your go to for a business or vacation travel.\",\n",
       " 'My experience is a unique one. Not everyone’s Dad worked at the Ambassador in the 60’s. I grew up hearing the Sinatra, Kennedys, Garland, and even Lassie stories of staying at the Ambassador. I felt like I knew every inch of the property, but yet as an adult, had never stayed there. Decades (I mean, decades) later, I stayed there for the first time. I couldn’t help my emotions and told Kay at the front desk my story. She seemed as excited as I was, and I felt so welcomed by her reaction, almost as if I was coming home. My husband and I settled into our room when room service knocked on the door. I told my husband that they probably made a mistake so I would let them know. The young man said that “This was for Ingrid”, and I said that there must be a mistake and he insisted that',\n",

The room was spectacular and so comfortable yet luxurious, and I really felt like I made the right decision. Aside from the amenities, I also really appreciated the kind staff. While everyone was wonderful, I particularly enjoyed a bellman who helped me out named Ismaeel! This young man so warm, friendly and funny I instantly felt like I already knew him. On top of that, he did an excellent job with my bags. Just a great example of the quality staff at The Ambassador!\",\n",

There was a fire in the library when we arrived, which was quite welcoming. Our rooms (we had a celebrity suite + attached room, as well as another room down the hall) were clean, airy, bright, and well-appointed. We loved the toiletries. The beds were super comfortable, the rooms spacious. The views were terrific - all city!

We were asked to leave my cell phone so that the front desk a call when the room was ready. They never called. First morning, after calling at 6 AM when our next room neighbors were in ordinately loud, I was told that they could call to ask them to turn down',\n",

The hotel is on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood, and a short walk away from restaurants and entertainment. Our room was spacious, clean and made when we arrived.

Thank you, Kay for making our weekend! We will be back!',\n",

This was the BEST experience I have ever had while traveling for work. Not only was Kay attentive to all of her guest needs, she made me feel as if I was her only guest in the 200 + room hotel.

The rooms are very well appointed and spotless from a housekeeping standpoint.  We have not eaten there but for their standard breakfast sandwich and coffee fare. What is unusual is the reasonable price of the breakfast sandwich. It was very good too. In downtown Chicago you almost expect to pay more than average.

After one delay after another while traveling to the hotel, I was exhausted. Finding out that our room was not ready only made matters worse. I expressed my frustration but Ms.K remained calm and sympathized with me and upgraded our room.which was magnificent. Just talking to that young lady put me ino  a better mood. I wish more people who deal with the public could posses her attitude and willingness to help others',\n",

Hangers in the bathroom weren't tightly screwed and they were dangling from the wall as if the lightest load will be too much for them. Shower head was funny and hard to operate. Breakfast was quite terrible (if you are staying there, go to the 3rd Coast which is just 100m away). Staff is indeed helpful. Nevertheless, an average hotel with an average experience.\",\n",

Our first encounter was with the front desk staff member named Kay who presented us with stellar services from the moment we arrived. She was friendly, helpful and over accommodating. She made immediately feel welcomed. The hotel decor is beautiful, the staff was excellent, the food is delish and the rooms are next Level clean, even the housekeeping staff was excellent. We loved the view and we will definitely be returning for another stay in the future. As a lifelong Chicagoan, this is definitely a gem.',\n",

Other than the usurious $67 valet-only parking fee (NYC is less expensive), everything about the hotel was a pleasant surprise. The lobby is intensely attractive, as is the library, which has a fireplace (real, I think) and overpriced-but-drinkable coffee in the a.m. The restaurant is undergoing a big makeover, so we only had the room service menu in the bar area, but I have to say, the food was top drawer. The rooms are an intriguing mix of modern--lighting, super-low beds, gorgeous bathroom--with old-schools touches. There were some oddities (the closet, sans door, was the size of a small apartment), but I find this character appealing. The wifi worked. I was too lazy for the gym, but there is one. All in all,',\n",

It’s also very easily walkable from the Ambassador to Lake Michigan (jogging trail along the lake, sunbathing, etc.). The hotel itself is very clean and the service is excellent. The first time we were there we got bumped up to the Penthouse. It was exquisite and the whole place holds a lot of history. This is our go-to place whenever we are in town. ',\n",

The rooms are absolutely spacious and comfortable.  The location was perfect for my needs.  Safe area to go out and walk in.  Many eateries/restaurants near by that you can walk to.  Everyone at the front desk was friendly.  I may forget some names but Danella, Kenya, and Batista, were all wonderful.  But if I had to choose one favorite thing about this entire trip then I would have to say it was definitely Natalie at the front desk.

The hotel has bags of history as it was, we understand, frequently used in the 40s 50s and 60s by many of the entertainment stars who were travelling from New York to Los Angeles somebody took the trouble of obtaining photographs of theses artists which must have numbered in 100s all very interesting as we understood that the photographs were origionaly displayed in a bar but now, unfortunately, they are mostly displayed in a basement area by the toilets. It is a shame nobody ever thought of adding names to the photographs it was fine for the well know artists but for the lesser known ones they',\n",

Natalie came up with the great idea and Ishmael hustled to the store to get the necessities and returned in timely fashion.  Upon my departure, they personally made an effort to wish me well and to make sure if we were pleased with our stay.

But nothing by the bed or nightstand. 4) Japanese-style beds that are super low to the floor. 5) Walls that desperately need a fresh paint coat. In some places they have done patch jobs but not painted the full wall. 6) Bathroom tile flooring that needs new grouting. 7) Old door knobs and fixtures that are dilapidated.

We felt that the Ambassador delivered good value for our money.  ',\n",

First party checked in at 3:00 and they did not have the room ready until 4:00! Second party checked in at 4:00 and they did not have it ready until 4:30. Check in time is 3:00! For a boutique hotel that has been around for awhile, you need to step your game up significantly considering there are so many other hotels in Chicago. And to be quite frank, I've actually always gotten lucky and been able to check in and get a room BEFORE check in time at majority of hotels I travel to. Also the beds were listed as King beds which we selected and they appear to be queen beds instead. Very disappointed and do not recommend.\",\n",

Away from the noise, but within a short walk to lakeshore, Michigan Ave, subway, and old town.   My only issue was no coffee in the room. Had to go to the lobby in the morning to buy it from the barista. ',\n",

It followed the classic Schrager formula of renovating old dowager hotels, creating dazzling public spaces and turning small outdated sleeping rooms into funky-but-chic, design-forward places to lay one\\'s head after the party.  Even the epochal Pump Room, Frank Sinatra\\'s go-to gin mill when he visited Chicago, got Schragerized.   Apparently the new concept was only modestly successful, because Schrager sold out in 2016.

The owners have tried to retain as much of the old style charm as they possibly could while still  providing the amenities of a modern hotel My room was very big and quite comfortable. As other reviewers have stated some of the furniture in the room is a bit \"IKEAeske\" , not that there is anything wrong with IKEA furniture I had 2 minor issues with the hotel; - The room is a bit like a shop so there is just so much stuff such as hats etc. left out in the bedroom for you to buy, the management could probably do with',\n",

The valet parking lot is a couple of blocks away, so it takes 10-15min to retrieve a car minimum.  If someone is ahead of you it can be 20-30, so just plan ahead when you call for your car.  Breakfast items are overpriced, but I guess that is Chicago.  If you don't need to eat multiple plates of food, I would go to the Starbucks Roastery on the corner instead.\",\n",

The rooms were a bit on the small side, but very comfortable.  The rooms were recently updated and modern.  The location is perfect if you want to enjoy Michigan Ave, however we soon realized that Michigan Ave is suffering from the death of retail like most malls.  There just is not much to do.  The Starbucks Reserve Roastery is very close to this hotel, but we weren't that impressed with it.  One downside of this hotel is the street noise.  I've stayed in downtown hotels before and never had street noise this bad.  Multiple times during the night we woke up to sirens, revving engines, and squealing tires. \",\n",

On Day 2, our room was not cleaned when we returned after being out all day; we had to sit in the lobby for 45 minutes that evening while the room was made up. The person at \"customer service\" had the audacity to suggest that they just give clean towels instead. And we weren\\'t even offered a bottled water in the lobby for our troubles. In the restaurant for the included continental breakfast, on the first day the service was almost non-existent. There was no one available at the host\\'s stand for nearly 10 minutes.

I thought this was a huge inconvenience since it’s not practical to go to the lobby floor when your room is on a lower floor. I’ve been to other Conrad hotels where the lobby is not on the ground floor, but in those instances, rooms are all located above the lobby so it’s easy to stop in at the concierge or at the front desk if you need something on your way down and you're headed out for the day, or on your way up to\",\n",

No turndown service.   3) they couldn’t figure out how to make the electronic key on the Hilton app worked, despite several trips to the from desk.   4) still trying to figure out how to get the Hilton points for my paid stay from the property.

Front Desk representatives Emma, Yasmin and Christina. Emma almost singlehandedly held up the service commitment that I would expect as a Hilton Diamond member. She cares about her work and that says more than the gentlemen who checked me in.  Yasmin and Christina offered solid advice about the hotels offerings.

One night, I asked for help with two small things and they had no help or suggestions. Restaurant.. same behavior. Long waits to get seated for dinner, drinks or breakfast.

One thing to note: virtually everything other than the room itself costs money. If you are not a Hilton Honors member, you must pay for Wifi.

The only thing keeping me from a 5 bubble/5 star review is that the room seemed somewhat dingy and the bedding didn't fit the bed great, but it was fine.

Bathroom area is very large and  blah with a too low toilet seat.   Location is great and Happy Hour is \"Happy\", due to the gentleman named \"Jeremy\".  Food was also good, plentiful and filling.

We drove into Chicago from out of state and had no issues getting to/from the hotel. Valet parking is $70/night and you have 24 hour access to your vehicle, which is great.

It smelled like very rotten meat or a dead body in the lobby. I’m not exaggerating. When we asked an employee about the smell, he pretended he didn’t smell anything. The smell was in the lobby, only, thank God. The rooms were nice. We had a view of Lake Michigan from our room so that was a plus. After complaining about the smell the next day, it was finally gone the following morning.  ',\n",

In fact, minus the lobby, starbucks, and the elevators, nothing was open. While the staff were nice, I had a major problem with the couch in my room and the downstairs staff just took it as a nonchalant comment. I was there for several hearings and actually needed the suite living room for work. When my clients pointed out the dirty couch, it was too late to rectify with the staff.

And the dining staff for breakfast was absolutely amazing. The hostess Dinka even noticed when our daughter dropped her pacifier, came over, picked it up, and cleaned it without us even asking. They, also, provided us with snacks to take with for our baby.  Thank you, Dinka and all of the dining staff, for being so hospitable and making our stay an excellent one.

Tara Hubbard did a fabulous job from our first meeting to discuss a potential wedding venue, then the contract details, tasting and menu selection, final walk through, to the actual event date.

My view from my lake-view room was gorgeous at every turn, from morning arrival to the twinkling night lights of Chicago to the most gorgeous sunrise across the horizon, it was magical!  Service was the usual spectacular 5* service one gets at a Four Season and Chicago has down perfectly.  I needed museum tickets, they were in my email in 2 minutes.

The guest room product is second to none.  Also, the wings are the restaurant, which take 72-hours to prepare, are worth a trip alone.  If you're in the Chicago area and are in need of a life-changing experience, order those wings!  And have a few of their amazing cocktails and stay the night.  You will not regret it.

Typically we stay at the Peninsula when in the city but decided to give this property a try. We were upgraded to a lakefront suite, which was a nice surprise. The staff were all friendly and welcoming upon check-in. The room was small but tastefully designed. Everything was going well until we realized that there was absolutely no way we were going to get any sleep at night. Apparently something to do with the hydraulics of the building, its tall height and its windy lakefront location come together and cause incessant creaking/crackling sounds all night. There was no sleep to be had. We thought it was strange that turndown service had left',\n",
       " 'We have never had the opportunity to stay in a high end hotel in Chicago and the Four Seasons did not disappoint.  From arriving at the curb in a cab the bellman was friendly and very good at his job.  The front desk check in was efficient and we were very excited about an upgraded room to a Lake Michigan view.   We were shown around the spa pool area by a very helpful woman who helped us with slippers and robes while showing us how the lockers worked.  The pool area was not too busy but it was a Sunday night also.  The hot tub was nice and hot, even the pool was not very  chilly.   Breakfast was delightful the next morning and it was nice to relax before heading out to shop on Michigan Ave.   We definitely were spoiled and will be back again. We had a nice relaxing weekend',\n",

There are times I have booked a hotel to save money that has ended up being a nightmare, even in the higher priced chains. Four Seasons has offered my consistent stress free stays. I highly advise a try. It is conveniently located just of the magnificent mile across from Bloomiingdales and near Watertower. ',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Four Seasons during NBA All-Star Weekend. The first night of my 5-night stay was sleepless, as noises from plumbing, guests upstairs, and constant creaks from the wind kept me awake all night. Thankfully I had a friend staying at a neighboring hotel and was able to sleep there for my next 4 nights. After night 3, earplugs were left on the nightstand with a note saying that the wind was the root of the problem for the noise. Sorry, I'm not staying at the Four Seasons to wear earplugs in order to sleep.  The restaurant and bar were closed due to renovations, and the pop-up restaurant was in a bland conference room. Again, not something I expect from the Four Seasons. \",\n",

The friendly and professional service remains unchanged and unparalleled.  From the doormen to housekeeping staff, no hotel in Chicago treats guests better or offers a better stay.  Don’t stay away during the construction.',\n",

Our bathroom shower design left a large puddle of water on the floor after every shower and the plumbing is just old (not much water pressure either).  We complained three times but nothing changed.   The hotel is just old, the building creaks at night (due to wind outside, but still).     Seriously, the stay was really no nicer than a any mid tier hotel.  Based on this experience I don’t think I’d stay at a Four Seasons in general.   BTW, the people working there are very nice and the doormen outside were fantastic, friendly and helpful.   But overall not worth the price with other options',\n",

They loved all of the goodies at check-in, the snacks and extras that were waiting for them when we would arrive back after a long day of exploring the city. A special thanks to the concierge team who sent up another stuffed \"Sammy\" after our original Sammy went for a swim in a toilet while attending a show!

When i went to swim i saw FOURTEEN kids in the pool at 8pm. the water was mirky, they were consuming food in the poor and after one length , my hands caught some hair and some \"Thing\" else that i couldn\\'t identify. the adults were drinking from glass containers and there was broken glass at one end of the pool edge.

I highly recommend they find a solution or make two adults only times. 1pm-2pm and 9pm-10pm.   The room had an amazing view and the staff was very friendly. Valet parking is expensive so be prepared. The complimentary coffee, got chocolate was outstanding and it’s connected to a shopping plaza so that’s nice. Great location as well. ',\n",

This time we chose the Four Seasons because our previous stay was memorable, it was disappointing that when we made our reservation we were no informed that the lobby and restaurant are under renovation. It did make our stay less enjoyable, breakfast is only available via Room Service, the food was good but not what we are used to have at the Restaurant. There is a temporary cafe in the lobby area that offers coffee and light bites. Aster Hall in the 900 Michigan Avenue Mall is a great option, you just take the elevator to the 6th floor.

While we were in Chicago, we visited Willis Tower, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, and the River Walk. None of them are really within walking distance of the hotel, but they're all about a five minute Uber away.  We booked two rooms, which were right next to each other and were mirror images. While the hotel lobby is around about the 7th floor, the rooms start somewhere near the 30th floor, so there really are no low-floor rooms. We had rooms on or around the 40th or so floor, facing back towards the city (rather than the lake). While I expect the view on the other side of the building is better, our 'city view' was nothing to sneeze at. Both rooms were very nicely\",\n",

They anticipated every need I had and needs I didn’t even know I had - like leaving me a really bookmark for my book on my nightstand.  The staff were extremely friendly and go out their way to help out.  We were traveling on business for my husband and received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful view of Lake Michigan.  The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I’ve ever slept in!  The fitness room is on the smaller size, working out in the morning I was restricted to only cardio.  There were personal trainers taking up the weights section.  Thank you Four Seasons for providing excellent service and being so friendly, we look forward to future stays!',\n",

It is also annoying to have to get one set of elevators to the 7th floor to get the lobby, and then take a different set to the rooms.   This is an expensive hotel and it is simply not worth the money ...',\n",

Bags brought up to room quickly and check in fine. 2) Room had a beautiful Lake View but small standard size...not current 5 star standards. Bathroom for wheelchair users an afterthought. Knobs for water on front wall of shower...not handy for wheelchair user on a bench.  Room dimensions small for manevering around.

My room was standard and ok but no frills.  I had a massage at the spa, where the reception staff was very kind and helpful but the 50mns massage at $220 was a joke.

The room was perfect. Very spacious with a Great Lake view. Room service and housekeeping were top notch. Excellent turn down service every evening.   Special thanks to the night manager, Raul Ibarra, who showed great kindness and professionalism when I had a dispute with my credit card company. It was not the Four Season’s fault but he stepped up to make it right and I really appreciated it. ',\n",

A horrific experience with a horrific front desk staffer at both check-in and check-out, plus the hotel's non-response to my written complaint (this was back when guest surveys were completed on paper and mailed), kept me away from the Four Seasons in the ensuing years, during which time I would stay most frequently at the Ritz Carlton (which was then a Four Seasons hotel as well), the Langham (in Mies van der Rohe's IBM Building), and the Hotel Burnham (now the Staypineapple) in the historic Reliance Building in the Loop.  I was enticed back to the Four Seasons for this trip by a great rate offered by my Chicago-based professional association.  I'm happy\",\n",

Regarding the hotel itself  there is nothing magic apart the magic view I had from my room.  The deco of the lobby is 80's , old fashion.  My suite was large ..but neutral...sad.  Bathroom are so so overaged BUT SUPER WELL MAINTENAIDED.  I am really impressed by the so good condition of the bathroom as it is looking so hold. Everything is super clean and perfect condition.

Upon trying to take my car out I was informed by the valet,  I’m not entitled to in and out privileges because I didn’t pay with the hotel. I wish the hotel would make this more clear upon checking in. Beware',\n",

You had the sense that they enjoyed their job and wanted to make sure their guests felt comfortable and at home. The front desk staff were polite and efficient.  We encountered Monse and Denise during our stay and they were both a pleasure to deal with.  I can not say enough good things about Russell the concierge on duty the weekend we were there.  He was quite simply put, AMAZING.  He answered many questions prior to our arrival and then greeted us with a friendly smile that made us all feel like we knew him for years.

Without hesitation or request, he offered a solution and moved me to a fantastic new room with a king bed and river view. He didn’t have to. Technically the hotel had already “solved” the problem but Trevor didn’t see it that way. The bar is also totally worth a visit. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Especially Kat.

Though the hotel was busy with guests in a full lobby, hotel staffers Wayne and Ed went above and beyond to ensure we were warmly greeted upon arrival and took care of our belongings to get them to our room. Our suite was beautiful and spacious with plenty of room to relax, two tv's, and a fully stocked mini bar (they even made sure to add a few special treats to our room to make our first family getaway even more special). The bathroom was huge with so much natural light! My husband particularly enjoyed a drink in the lobby bar and said that Tim (the bartender) makes the best Old Fashioned he's ever had.

We had room service which was outstanding for breakfast but most of all, Joanna helped us with everything from navigating the city to find what we needed to parking.

An early evening snack/ happy hour foods would be a welcome addition.  The staff here are very good - pleasant and attentive.

The concierge Russell was so helpful in finding activities and restaurants nearby. After asking for directions to a restaurant they walked us part way there to help us find it and then the next day asked how our meal was.   Our room was a spacious upgrade but it could have used some updating which is why I took off a star. However, the very kind and thoughtful staff made up for the room's dated decor. The lobby was beautiful with a nice fireplace for chilly Chicago days.   The location is in walking distance of some kid favs like Ghirardelli and Sugar Factory.   The concierge lounge, Club Maxwell, is open 24 hours to grab a water or soda which is a nice perk.\",\n",

I stayed here twice this year for conferences and the staff on the 4th floor were super nice and prompt when serving, cleaning, and assisting us with anything that we needed.

There is no mat and it seemed like there once were anti-slip strips/stickers but had been removed or completely worn down. My husband slipped and fell out of the shower.
