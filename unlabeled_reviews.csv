1,"My parents came to this hotel in August because I was having a family reunion at home and it was too small to accommodate them, I would like to thank the staff for their kindness and for having met the expectations of my parents, they loved their stay with you, beautiful room with all the comfort they needed, excellent breakfast, thank you"
2,"The staff was amazing and offered such great advice on tours and food options.  The hotel is perfectly located for a lot of walking options.  A ton of wonderful restaurants within a block or two.  Shopping was close by as well.  The only drawback and it’s minor, which comes from my builder husband, was they should fix the poor job of wallpapering in the bathroom.  Too late to fix, but may we suggest doing it over with a better company.  They did not do your hotel justice.  It’s evident in other areas the upgrades were spared no expense.  Just a suggestion.  By no means would this keep us from coming back!"
3,"We stayed at the kinzie this past weekend and we were greeted by Arturo Garza. He was one the the most genuine and nicest person I’ve yet encounter at a hotel. He was extremely helpful with local restaurants, things to do, and even suggested a few of his favorite spots to visit. This experience made my stay more enjoyable and I was more welcomed into the city. Thank you for everything Arturo!  Highly recommend"
4,"The staff was very welcoming from walking through the doors. The suite, omg, the pictures are nothing compared. It was beautiful and we will definitely be back. Thank you for the hospitality and the breakfast"
5,"It was the first time my friends and I stayed at the Kinzie Hotel and we were so happy Arturo took such good care of us. Arturo made our check-in process very easy and was cheerful through out the whole process. He also explained to us about the Happy Hour the hotel offers, and he brought us some cute little wine bottles we had picked from the variety he offered from. Arturo made us feel delighted when we were around him, very nice hotel and excellent service!  Definitely coming back soon! "
6,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Kinzie hotel while waiting on my apartment to be ready. I would like to say the front desk guy Nico was soo pleasant and amazing. He accommodated next with everything i needed, everytime i entered he gave me a warm welcome and a sense of feeling wanted.. Also there was a very nice young lady with curly hair who assisted me when i needed to extent my trip an extra day. Overall everything was perfect, clean, and neat. Will visit again one day and you can thank Nico and the nice lady with curly hair(sorry forgot your name) at the desk."
7,"We were very pleased with our stay at the Hotel. Theas very cozy, clean and comfortable. We truly enjoyed the large tube, only wishing the shower had an attachment because of my height 😊. The staff Arturo Garza was very, professional, friendly, engaging and patient, he really made feel welcome. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to all my friends and family."
8,"Great Hotel in the middle of Everything, Great Rooms, ( I had a suite), it was one of the best views of the city , I have ever had, Great , Great , Great.Walking Distance to Great Restaurants and Shopping. Evening Reception with Free , yes I said Free Wine was Great."
9,"This would be a nice hotel if it were 3 stars, but rating it as a four star hotel is unrealistic.  Our room was had mold on growing on ceiling.  The walls were banged up.  It’s definitely in need of some repairs.  The location is fabulous.  The staff were kind and courteous.  However there wasn’t enough staff.  With only one staff member, there was a long wait to check in on a Monday afternoon.  The wait to get my car was even longer the next day, at least 20 minutes.  Over $70 a day to park and with such a long wait, we should have just parked it ourselves.  The city view should be called a street view, as the building is so much lower than the others you don’t see much except for the street below and 1-2 buildings.  It’s not a bad place, just not a great place either.  "
10,"Everything was perfect, nice staff, great view, great location, TV had Netflix. Great restaurants we’re in walking distance, close walk to a great mall, navy pier was close as well. Really peaceful stay and me and the wife definitely will be back soon"
11,Great place to stay in downtown Chicago. Across from an iconic restaurant and near lake shore drive. The staff was excellent especially Michelle. She went over and above to make sure we were welcome and appreciated. Room was cool and clean. Thank you so much we will be back
12,"The Hotel has an AWFUL customer service, I did my checkout and on my way to the airport I notice I forgot my Apple Watch and reported to a staff member Andrew who the only thing he did was send me link to report the item, which I did and attached a picture of the Find my iPhone show where it was and was easy to find because it receives calls, they refused to check the room while the Apple Watch still had battery, they notify me the next day that they did not find my watch. Let me tell you I’ve stay in not good looking room but staff more customer service related.  The watch disappear even with pictures of location during several hours and it can not be found. Shame. Besides that they only clean your room if you’re out before 8am, forget the experience of vacation waking up later"
13,"Wasn't sure what to expect during this unusual summer, but this place was better than expected. We had a suite, with amazing windows floor to ceiling.  We checked in early a couple of hours without any hassle. Did not try the ""to go""breakfast, but did enjoy the ""happy hour"" wine. Great location on a semi-quiet street. Easy walk to the Riverwalk, Michigan Ave, and Millenium Park. Also, the price for a suite was lower than a standard room at most of the other nice hotels in the area. Also, lady at front desk told us about ""spot hero"" app that saved us $50 on parking. Great deal!"
14,"Its really clean, modern and upscale. Its smaller so it feels like a nice boutique hotel, yet it feels like it has the standard of an amazing high end large hotel chain. I was also surprised that we had a view overlooking a really cool outdoor patio. Its right next to amazing upscale restaurants with outdoor patios. This is a good hotel for tourism, business or anything! They gave us big bottles of wine at check in so that was cool, too!"
15,"My friends and I took a quick trip to Chicago to celebrate my birthday! The Kinzie Hotel was the perfect hotel for all of our needs. The staff was very hospitable, helped my friends surprise me by hiding cake and Party needs. Our accommodations were perfect for our weekend away. We felt very safe and secure given the COVID19 life we all live now. The Kinzie Hotel provides services at your leisure while also reducing risk. Andrew the manager provided a great guide on how to enhance your stay while also feeling like your healthy and safety are priority! Oh & best of all the location is perfect for sight seeing, dining and outdoor experiences ! You won’t be disappointed! The rooms are clean , modern, and provide great Chicago views! Oh and they have a cool photo booth in the lobby"
16,"Amazing. The place was clean, the staff was prompt, the location was in the middle of everything that we needed to get to. I was very grateful for the working crew and positive energy that we were treated with."
17,"I used to stay at another hotel in the area but it was full. I was getting tired of that place anyway because they were overcharging for what should be affordable rooms. I guess I had an Idea of what affordable looked like for near the Loop and expected the same sort of space from Kinzie because the price was close. The room at Kinzie exceeded these expectations; windows, amenities, coffee pods and robust WiFI, but also the desk staff treated me like I was some sort of VIP. The staff immediately read my situation when I arrived (tired, hungry, barely social or communicative) there was some sort of glitch with my reservation because I used an app that was being weird. They were bright and cheerful and made me feel comfortable as they quickly accommodated. I opted to pay for"
18,"We really enjoyed our stay in Chicago, even though it was for a short time. The Kinzie Hotel was very clean, had beautiful views, and great light cancelling shades. Michelle at the front desk was so helpful and welcoming! She is a gem of an employee!"
19,My 35th bday. Amazing Staff Very Professional and Kind. Breakfast section is awesome and healthy choice. Will definitely repeat business here. Thanks Kinzie Hotel. Love the theme lobby as well. Great security after hours too.
20,"My room was small but nice. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but I'll chalk that up to COVID-19 and social distancing.  I had a view of Kinzie Street as well as the Trump Hotel after I requested a high floor with a view. The staff was very friendly and informative, all except the valet which seem to take at least 30 mins and cost $73 a night which was almost the price of my room! That being said, I had a decent stay in downtown Chicago for a fairly low price!!"
21,This hotel accepted to cancel our reservation without fee due to the current sanitary situation while we had not booked with a cancellation facility. THANK YOU VERY MUCH Kinzie Hotel !! Next time in Chicago we visit you !
22,"My friend booked a room at the Kinzie Hotel for business and decided to have me over for dinner. I went to the front desk to ask if there was water to purchase. Raul Villarreal was very helpful and even gave some recommendations for some things to visit in the area. All in all, his hospitality and warm smile made the stay even that much better. Thanks Raul!"
23,"I just want to take a minute and shout out Raul Villarreal! He was very accommodating and helpful at the front desk, when I had some specific questions about the area. Because of his hospitality alone, I’ll definitely consider rebooking at the Kinzie Hotel."
24,"We have been trying out different boutique hotels in Chicago over the past year or so, and this was one of the nicest we’ve stayed at. We had a corner suite, and it was well laid out, furnished very nicely, floor to ceiling windows with electronic drapes, and very intimate and luxurious. The front desk staff here are stellar at their jobs, especially Lexy and Lupe!! They truly are two of the most friendly and welcoming desk staff I’ve encountered in many years of staying in hotels. Andrew, the GM, also was very welcoming and genuinely wanted our anniversary there to be special. The Kinzie Hotel truly is a “diamond in the rough”, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an intimate, well appointed boutique hotel, in a great location, in Chicago. Looking forward to"
25,"Family business required that my wife and I travel to Chicago for the weekend. In spite of the fact that the city is largely shut down, and the hotels that are open are very limited in terms of the amenities they can offer, the Kinzie was such a nice positive experience. Extremely friendly and accommodating staff, great rooms – wonderful floor to ceiling windows with a nice chaise lounge to sit and watch the city rest – great location, great vibe. We will definitely return!"
26,"Our stay at the Kinzie Hotel was absolutely perfect! From the moment we checked in, everything and everyone was incredible. A great location, an exceptionally clean room and friendly, helpful staff make this an obvious choice for anyone traveling to Chicago. Highly recommended!!!"
27,"We have stayed here a number of times when we come to town for Blackhawk games, the theater, or just to get away. The cost, the location, and the friendliness of the staff are exceptional (Mona and Derrick). If you are a walker, it is very easy to  walk to attractions both north and south. The continental breakfast is more than enough to send one out for the day, and the wine/beer in the evening is a plus. Then, too, the discount at the Public House next door is great for a drink or light meal. Parking fees are steep, but they can be reduced by using Spot Hero for nearby parking garages if you don't want to go in and out."
28,We loved our stay st the Kinzie Hotel. Perfect location. Close walk to so much. Rooms are clean and spacious. Fun complimentary hour hour and breakfast. Especially great bellman Derrick in the morning and Alex in the evening. Highly recommend and we've found where we'll stay from now on!
29,"We stayed at the Kinzie hotel from March 2 through March 7. Martin, the hotel manager, went out of his way to accommodate us with our requested room. Service was outstanding from every employee; doorman, housekeeping, front desk, bartender, and even the maintenance person. Location couldn’t be better. I loved the layout of the room with a long desk bar in the bedroom and a full countertop in the bathroom (no lousy non-functional decorative pedestal sinks in this hotel). An empty refrigerator was available in the room, perfect for in room beverages. We’ve stayed here multiple times and look forward to returning. "
30,"Cozy and stylish room! Appreciated the extra things offered in the room, especially for getting ready. LOVED the complimentary happy hour! The only thing I wasn’t a fan of was our view. 😕 Great location to restaurants, bars, music venues, and shopping!"
31,"I've traveled all over the world and stayed at some of the best hotels. I didn't know what to expect when I booked a room at Kinzie Hotel. Not only was my greeting upon arrival and check-in pleasant and easy, the room was modern, clean and pretty cool! Bathroom and fixtures were well done. Strong shower. Ordered room service and had one of the best salads of my life! I admired the pens in the room and upon checkout asked if I could have a couple...the fellow ran out and secured me a few to take with me. Great location and a great stay. I was pleasantly surprised and will recommend Kinzie Hotel to friends and family visiting me in Chicago."
32,"I very much enjoyed my stay at the Kinzie Hotel. From the ""informal"" lobby full of friendly staff to the generous rooms with lots of natural light, this hotel offers a great atmosphere. The continental breakfast and cocktail hour were much better than what is offered in more standard ""chain"" hotels. The location was convenient to meetings I had in the Loop, even walkable in some cases. I highly recommend this option and will definitely return!"
33,"Spent two nights here over the weekend. Excellent location and easy to find. Lovely, friendly staff and a quirky design. Rooms are clean and fresh and the bed was super comfy. Loved the complimentary breakfast and happy hour. Looking forward to returning in April, June, July and September!"
34,"I was greeted by friendly staff, stayed in a very modern and comfortable room, and enjoyed a tasty breakfast the next morning. Other perks were easy check out, text communication with the concierge, and a happy hour for all guests.  Would recommend this hotel to others and will absolutely stay here again."
35,"Great hotel, excellent location. Staff consistently friendly and helpful. Bed comfy. Love the happy hour and free breakfast. Only suggestion would be more choice on room service, with some more healthy options. Will be back in April. Thank you to the wonderful staff."
36,We stayed at the Kinzie for two days for a quick trip. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Thank you to staff Mona and Derrick for going the extra mile to make our stay great! We will definitely be back.
37,"This hotel was awesome. It’s located in River north close to various bars,clubs,lounge and restaurants. The hotel has great staff. The room was luxurious with all the amenities. I will definitely stay here again."
38,I had a FANTASTIC experience with the front desk attendant Mona and Victor were completely FANTASTIC. The bartender Matt was amazing as well. Great room & Amazing amenities and Beautiful property. Amazing!! I booked the room close to a testing center I had exams at the following day and had a great night rest and was able to walk 5-7 mins to my exams. Thank you to the AWESOME Kinzie Staff for making my night stay WONDERFUL!
39,I went to Chicago for a short girls' trip with my two daughters and cousin.  I can't say enough about how we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Kinzie! We loved how it was so personal. The rooms were wonderful and we felt like the staff was really watching out for us. We felt very safe!  The location couldn't have been better. Located right in the middle of everything on the river downtown. So many things in walking distance. We walked to dinner and a super cool tiki bar the first night. Hit a ping-pong club the second. We would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone!

45,"So it's been a while since my visit and am just now getting around to reviewing, as I just came across my room photos on my phone. Anyhooo, it's a really lovely hotel. Nicely decorated. Very comfortable room. Nice lounge/cocktail hour upstairs. Had an off the street room so no noise issues, but not much in the way of a view. It really was just a great hotel. "
46,"Had the best corner room on the 4th floor! So many windows and the view was really nice! The best past was Spencer at concierge, he was very friendly and personable  and gave us such positive experience I love how they offer a text message service for places to eat and places to go within walking distance which is helpful for people from out of town. Also Derrick at Valet was very friendly and helpful. Thank you for such a great Customer service and we have already told our friends to stay here next time! We hope to be back soon!  -Kristal & Tom H."
47,Room was perfect and very relaxing.  We were sad to miss the managers reception this time but have gone to it several times before.  Greeted warmly by the bell captain and then by the front desk.  The hotel was spotless
48,"We LOVED staying at the Kinzie. The Staff was Exceptional and made the experience so wonderful. We brought our two large dogs. They loved all the attention, the dog beds and houses, the treats, and the toys. They are still wearing their Kinzie bananas a week later. We used the valet for our car and had to trouble the staff with putting away and bringing out our car multiple times so we could drive it to our locations. The Staff always had a smile and never complained. I have been recommending the Kinzie to everyone I meet, telling them to stay there regardless of if they have dogs or not. We will 100% be back to stay next time we visit Chicago. THANK YOU."
49,"Only good things to say about our stay! Great location near great bars, jazz clubs, short walk to Michigan Ave. Loved the nightly happy hour. Room and amenities were awesome and staff were always friendly, greeting us everytime we returned. And on top of all that...great price!! "
50,"Will definitely be back to stay in the Kinzie hotel, from the spacious bedroom to the happy hour we enjoyed all the Kinzie had to offer. It's in an ideal location, with pubs, restaurants and shopping all in walking distance, as is access to all forms of public transport. The staff were friendly and helpful, the text service with reception was useful and included recommendations on things to see and do."
51,"Visited this hotel on Boxing Day for 5 days with my sister to see Chicago and shop. The hotel was very central to everything and we had a great time. The room was lovely, very spacious and clean. Great lounge time each night for 2 hours with wine, beer and snacks. Also continental breakfast good too. The hotel staff were the most friendly amazing people and we will definitely be returning here in the future. This was my first visit but my sisters third, we loved Chicago.  Special thank you to Lexi who was an amazing help when our flight got cancelled, she was so patient and helped us deal with airline, rebook into hotel and also sorted our transfer back to airport. We are so grateful and hope to thank you in person some day.  All the staff were great, brilliant hotel, would"
52,"My 15-year-old daughter and I headed to Chicago the day after Christmas to enjoy the lights on Michigan Avenue and do some shopping. The Kinzie Hotel was perfect for us! So close to Michigan Avenue for walking, and the staff could not be any nicer! This hotel was clean and the staff were so helpful when I had a problem with my reservation. My reservation problem was not the hotel’s fault, it was Booking.com’s error, but the Kinzie staff corrected it for me. I will stay here again!!"
53,"The bride picked this as her base for the wedding so all the bridesmaids and family stayed here and we were treated like royalty.   From check in to check out we were pampered, taken care of and generally loved to death.   The happy hour and breakfast buffets were fun and appreciated. And the rooms were soundproof and large.   We will definitely stay here again - even without the bride!!  Well done, Kinzie! And special thanks to Victor who helped me  get through a couple of rough patches!!"
54,"Booked this hotel for fun romantic getaway and birthday celebration.  Unfortunately our child fell ill at home and we were unable to complete our stay.  The manager would not work with us whatsoever.  Have stayed here several times before but will find somewhere else to patronize in the future.  Love staying in River North, but fortunately there are numerous other options."

60,"We stayed here last year at around Thanksgiving time.  Even though there is a huge choice of hotels in Chicago, we decided to go back here as we loved it so much last year.  Just as good.  A great breakfast included in the room rate - cereals, porridge, muesli, yoghurts etc. And pastries, doughnuts, rolls, hard boiled eggs.  Coffee, tea etc. They still have the 2 hour happy hour period when you can have complimentary wines and beers in the lounge area - great!  The rooms are a fair size for city rooms - noticed a few scuffs on the walls this year.  Lovely comfortable big bed and complimentary toiletries.  Snacks for sale in the room.  And a fridge to store bits if you wish.  A very good experience once again."
61,"We had a great stay at the Kinzie Hotel this past weekend. Spencer checked us in, and he has a really warm and welcoming way about him. We loved the location, easy walking to so many restaurants! Was really nice to have a little continental breakfast, and evening wine reception. Would stay here again! Thanks to all at the Kenzie!"
62,Kinzie Hotel is a boutiqe hotel. The lobby is small and efficient.  There is an included breakfast room for continental breakfast coffee and tea.  The locaton is convenient.  I walked to the theater district in abourt 10 -15 minutes and then headed the other direction for 1--15 minutes to the Magnificent Mile for shopping. The room was large and clean
63,"The Kinzie hotel staff were welcoming and friendly from the beginning to the end of our 4 night stay. The hotel is close to lots of restaurants (and the Kinzie has lots of deals and coupons for many of them). The hotel is also pretty close to the river walk, some hop on bus locations, and Michigan Avenue!"
64,"Across from Harry Carey’s, AMA building and a Trump Tower/Hotel. Easy walk to magnificent mile and Clark/Lake train depot. Room clean. Nice staff. Resort fee added to nightly rate to cover breakfast/ free evening reception. TF"
65,Just recently got back from Chicago!  Celebrating our 30th anniversary  and stayed at the kinzie hotel!  Just wanted to thank Spencer and his team for making our stay amazing and for welcoming us with champagne!! Loved this hotel very clean comfortable and the staff are very pleasant!  Thank you for making us feel right at home!  Love the wine between 5 and 7 nice touch before dinner!  Breakfast buffet was included and definitely will return one day!
66,"Check in was quick and easy, and we really appreciated the perks of the hotel - it was conveniently located to pretty much everything we wanted to do, complimentary beer/wine/snacks at happy hour, continental breakfast, friendly staff, a bunch of Chicago information in the room, etc.  We were here on a Saturday and Sunday night and even though we were only on the 2nd floor facing the street, it was very quiet and peaceful each time we came back to our room to rest.  Everything was clean and modern, and our regular King room/bathroom was spacious.  Checkout was also easy, no need to stop by the front desk since a receipt was slipped under our door and you can checkout using the TV. We’ll definitely be back soon!"
67,"We were lucky to find this hotel for a 4 day stay for a family occasion!! They have a complimentary breakfast as well as a free Happy Hour every day! Staff are friendly & helpful. Hotel is within walking distance of main avenues, wonderful restaurants & attractions. The concierge found us an awesome Uber driver who took us everywhere during our stay. Rooms were clean & spacious. We would definitely stay there again!!"
68,"We arrived at the hotel late (9 PM) and had an excellent, quick check-in process upon arrival.  We were advised of the ""complimentary"" breakfast in the morning and wine/beer reception at night.  Our room was on the 5th floor, and I panicked when we passed a men's room in the hallway.  I thought I had mistakenly booked us at a communal hotel where we had to share bathrooms.  We entered our room and I immediately felt relief when I saw the bathroom.  Our room was very clean and decently spacious for our brief stay in Chicago.  We slept great, too.    We took advantage of the breakfast one morning and the wine, beer, and snacks one evening.  I'm glad we did, because I got a bill after checkout that charged me a $25/day amenity fee for such things as these ""complimentary"" food and"
69,"One of the best Hotels for the value my wife and I have stayed in. Clean and tastefully decorated rooms,happy hour with all the wine/beer and snacks free of charge from 5-7,breakfast and without a doube one of the better located Hotels in Chicago. We were able to walk to any number of restaurants and shopping areas with ease and safety. The staff : Spencer, George,Victor and a number of others could not be more friendly,helpful and professional. What a great find."
70,"I am very sorry to say that this hotel and its staff does not care at all about the global trash problems. All plates, glasses or tableware they use is all plastic to throw immediately away. All the breakfast servings, EVERYTHING, is plastic to throw away. When asked about it, they just say they are not equipped otherwise and it is perfectly fine to create tons of new waste everyday. It is amazing that a hotel still thinks this way in 2019 - i will never stay here again till they have solved this issue for good. The only way to ask them to change is to show them that people do care about the environment and I will stay at hotels who do work accordingly"
71,"Everything you want in a hotel- clean rooms, helpful staff, free WiFi, free happy hour beers, great breakfast buffet. Super impressed and will definitely be back to stay. Oh yeah, they let you bring dogs too which is awesome"
72,Lovely quiet room. Spotless cleaning. Central location and Great restaurants nearby. Especially Joe’s Seafood prime steak and Crab. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely stay at Kinzies hotel next time I visit Chicago. 
73,"The staff, especially Matt and Spencer, were so helpful. The whole experience was wonderful!  I stayed 5 nights this week so was able to try several restaurants  which were an easy walk. Snacks at happy hour were a plus. My traveling companion had a nut allergy but Matt always found her a nonpeanut treat.  Breakfast was nice but pastries seemed dry. I loved the granola and yogurt. I hope to return soon."
74,"I arrived real early at 9 am for the check in. I was so surprised that they were able to let me check in right away without storing the luggage and came back at later time. I was super hungry at that time from catching the 6 am flight from NY (remember the one hour different) When the front desk gentleman Spencer told me that they have the breakfast ready for me on 6th Floor, it simply melt my heart. The next day, since it was the marathon weekend, they specifically prepared a 5 am breakfast for all the runners with bananas, protein bars, Gatorade etc, but not donuts or pastry. After the marathon, in addition to the late check out they provided, they also let me to use their restroom to change and clean up myself. Their service is superb. Front desk is super friendly and"
75,"The rooms are very nice.  Well decorated, and very comfortable bed.   Just a block from the river.   Free continental breakfast and even afternoon snacks.   Like this hotel a lot.   Wifi is fast and good and the staff is very attentive."
76,"The Kinzie was amazing. We stayed 3 days, our concierge Spencer was very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the happenings in Chicago. He had some hook ups to assist us in food lines and gave us updates on where the best places for jazz and food. He even surprised us with a complimentary champagne with a handwritten letter of congratulations. He made the Chicago experience seamless and better. The room was on the 5th floor, we had a corner room that enabled us to see city views and the night lights. I will definitely return to the Kinzie."
77,"The room was clean and comfortable. They offer a Continental Breakfast and a Happy Hour on the 6th floor. Great to grab a bite and coffee in the morning. The Happy Hour was a little too loud for me, but the fact that they offer it, is nice. I was doing work at The Mart, so the location was convenient. Loads of restaurants around within walking distance. Staff was very friendly. Would stay here again."
78,"I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last 2 years.  It is always a great landing spot; with great service, clean rooms, quiet during evening hours.  The complimentary happy hour is a plus.  Nice sized work out room"
79,I stayed here because of the convenient location. I only spent one night but my room (facing the street) was quiet and comfortable with a vew of Harry Carrays. The price was reasonable for a downtown hotel.
80,"The hotel has its benefits. The biggest ones are the location, polite staff and clean rooms. The pricing is reasonable and it was cheaper than most nearby hotels. I am not giving it 5 stars only because breakfast could be a bit more varied."
81,"Pros:  Great location, big room - clean.  Friendly staff - breakfast bar was small but good and the staff there were mostly friendly.  Cons:  Not soundproof at all - you can see light coming in through the door to the hallway - means it was very loud when there were people in the hall.   They charged our credit card TEN TIMES for the $80 authorization charge.  TEN!  The charges eventually came off the card - but at one point we had $800 US  (and we're canadan) tied up on our card.  That was ridiculous and made me wonder about the security of our card in general."
82,This hotel has a fantastic location and it was very nice. It appears to be a renovated apartment. It was a loft style room. We would stay here again.  Our only complaint was the high priced parking.  Our car was also filthy when it was returned to us. We parked it and left it for 2 full days. 
83,"Excellent location for theatre trips, shopping, and dining. A short cab ride to the hotel from Union Station or an easy walk on a nice day. Nice room but was surprised when we entered that the lobby was actually several floors up. No big deal, just unusual. Would definitely consider staying again."
84,"We loved it here! My husband and I  originally stayed at the Cambria Hotel Loop, the experience wasn’t as great as it was here in Magnificent Mile.  The room here is fantastic,  the size was of the room was huge, organized,  clean, the view is beautiful, overall the hotel is great, made us have a easy experience of seeing Chicago. Our stay was great because of one person here most. We need more people like Ms. Elizabeth  Massey, she works as a receptionist here,  she is so sweet, friendly and extremely nice, she is the one that made sure we had the best time, and was comfortable, she helped us with everything, very hard worker. Having good staff like her that goes above and beyond  is the reason that makes this hotel special compared to other hotels. We will definitely return to"
85,"Unprofessional staff. So many things to name that went wrong & that were handled incorrectly. They charged the wrong credit card. The dresser in our room was missing drawers, we did not have a remote to the tv, only one elevator working in the hotel, people were picketing outside of the hotel the entire weekend, they charged me $62 a day for parking when I was supposed to have the $25 per day parking package, I called the hotel on 4 different occasions before the arrival and not one note was put on my reservation!!! That is what Hector said anyway!! I have names and dates of every time I called & person I spoke to. NOT ONE NOTE ADDED!! Was charged $9.95 a day for a service fee. WHAT SERVICE FEE??? This hotel did nothing to service my family. It was a mess from the start. I even"
86,Had to Cancel a trip due to my Mother becoming extremely sick and dying !! Asked hotel for a refund Hotel said tuff luck !! Don’t want to stay at a hotel that is only interested in profit and not accommodating guest when they have an issue !!
87,"Excellent location, staff was amazing would do anything to make your stay enjoyable!  We Would highly recommend!  The bloody Mary’s were awesome. Our room  was very clean!  Yes picketers outside did not affect our stay 1 bit"
88,Our experience with the hotel was in generally nice. We stayed 3 nights in a king room.  Will brief as follows :  🌷Room was spacious and clean. 🌷Bathroom was clean with a bathtub. No separate shower space. 🌷Bed was a few steps below the entrance so make sure to pick a correct room set up for your needs as they have many options. 🌷Coffee machine available.  🌷Safe available 🌷Free wifi 🌷Closet space was a bit small or am I an over packer 🤔🤔  Over the stay was great and relaxing.  🌷Elevators were only 2 for the higher level but it was OK.  🌷Strike is still ongoing in small numbers and is not bothering anyone    
89,"My husband and I stayed here during our recent visit to Chicago.  The property is located on the Magnificent Mile and is VERY conveniently located near upscale shopping and numerous quality restaurants.  If you are up to a longer walk, you can walk to the train as well.  Check-in was fairly easy and the staff were very friendly.  When we checked out, the front desk people were not as friendly.  This might've been because hotel employees were picketing the front of the hotel.  The picketers were apparently in a wage dispute with this hotel; had we known the hotel was being picketed, we would not have stayed there.  When we arrived, there was no picket line; the next morning, they were there.  The picketers made no attempt to enter the hotel and didn't try to keep us from coming"
90,"We stayed here for two nights mid November 2019.  We requested an early check in along with a late checkout and the staff was more than accommodating!  We received a voucher for the hotel bar which was an added plus.  The room was nice, big and clean.  Would stay at again"
91,The hotel is in a very convenient location to all the Mag Mile shops. Lobby was small but updated and clean. Rooms large and also clean. Shower had little to no hot water the entire weekend which was disappointing and we were charged a $20 resort fee which I found odd since there were no extra perks and we didn’t use WiFi. 
92,"I stayed 2 nights in a King Suite for a girls' trip. Check in was easy and pleasant, and I appreciated the offer the Cambria has to go green. If you opt not to have housekeeping come every day, you're offered a credit to use at the bar/coffee shop in the hotel. My room was very clean, comfortable and spacious. The showers are quite narrow, so if that's an issue for you a room with a tub might be better. The location is very convenient to shopping along the Magnificent Mile. Parking at the hotel is pricey, however. I recommend reserving a spot in the Olympia Centre garage one block over. You still get in and out privileges, but it's $25 cheaper. I would definitely stay in this hotel again on a future visit to Chicago."
93,"Our Family has booked two nights, two rooms @ The Cambria Hotel (Chicago).  My Dad , who is battling Cancer had some appointments @ Northwestern .  So we chose The Cambria for the location being close to the Hospital.  We had about a 3 hour drive to Chicago, which was hard on my Dad.  So when we pulled up, I explained this to the Bellman and he was beyond helpful letting me park out front, while I checked in.  The Girl @ the front desk was also beyond helpful and sped up checking in , so I could get my Dad in a room.  Then I realized we booked rooms without a bathtub, so I called the front desk and they moved us to rooms with a Bathtub, no questions asked (thank you, Dana).  I mentioned to the Bellman , it was our Daughter's 10th birthday and they brought up a small treat with a"
94,"The hotel is at the city of Chicago. Very convenient location. The decor is dated, but clean.The rooms are very big and clean. Service is good.  The rooftop is really nice. The bar area is well equipped."
95,"This hotel is just a block off the magnificent mile and in a great location!  Very close to the water tower, close to shopping.   Front desk staff was very helpful and prior to arrival I had made a phone call with questions and each time everyone was helpful.  You may check your bags if you arrive before your room is ready. Great decor, the lobby had nice seating plus a bar/snack/coffee area which was very handy.  We were on the 22nd floor and had a decent view.  We looked over a parking lot but weren’t looking at another building so that was good.  We had a king suite which had a seating area and it was very roomy.  The bathroom was small but we had a handicapped accessible room so that might be why it was more compact.  There were 3 steps down into the main space.  Decor was"
96,"Great location just of the Magnificent Mile with short distance from shopping and attractions. Spacious and clean rooms, but the staff certainly could offer more smiles. Some staff were on strike, maybe thats why they were not happy?"
97,"Stayed here as my base for the marathon, excellent location to get to start and finish. Food on side very limited, especially as a coeliac so didnt eat here. Rooms were very well equipped and clean. I did try and order a taxi for one day, and was told it had been booked but it never turned up ...... so if you need a taxi perhaps do it yourself. Hotel did supply all runners a breakfast bag which was very nice of them. Also some of the staff were on strike so not great crossing a picket line.  Overall a good hotel but a few issues did let them down."
98,"Stayed for six nights in a suite with king size bed and double fold which was in a partially separated area for our adult son who was there to run the marathon. The room was comfortable with efficient aircon for heating or cooling and very quiet. The main bed was too soft for our liking but that might just be us. The fold out sofa bed was not fit for purpose- just exposed springs so our son slept on the sofa in its non fold out state which he found to be fine and the room layout waorked perfectly for us. Although our room was on the 18th floor the lifts were fast and there was never a long wait for them. The offerings at the cafe in the foyer were okay but not as good as any of half a dozen places nearby- e.g Corner Bakery, Sunny Side Up.   All in all a very good stay in a great"
99,The hotel service was horrible!  The maid came to the room at 5pm to do the cleaning - the exact time we were trying to get ready for a big event. The maid coming to the room in the evening was very inconvenient!  I had to chose between getting ready in an uncleaned room or wait for the room to be cleaned and then rush to my event!  Very horrible room cleaning timing!  There were only 2 elevators for upper floors so there was almost always a wait - there was an elevator scare too where the elevator wasn't working right.  There is an over-priced bar/coffee shop on the lower floor.  The doorman couldn't call or get a taxi or do his job at all!  There were constant protestors outside due to a labor dispute.  The parking was $65 per night!!   The location was good & price cheap for
100,"The hotel was very conveniently located a half block off of Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile area.  The staff were very accommodating and the rooms had an interesting layout.  The rooms were also clean and comfortable.  Another attractive feature is that the hotel was relatively compact with only about 10 to 12 rooms per floor so it was much quieter than most large downtown hotels.  For the location, the cost was a great value.."
101,"Our 1st hotel on a Travelsphere tour. Modern easy to check in friendly helpful reception staff. Nice big clean room, had a safe, fridge, tea/coffee, hairdryer, etc. Very handy for walking into the city, about a 15min walk, we felt very safe in the area. The buffet breakfast was very good and the bar had a good choice of drinks. As for sleep, not too good in room 309, we had to turn our aircon off as it was too noisy, but we could hear the noisy aircon from surrounding rooms. Room 309 was at the side of the hotel where the dustbin wagons arrived early each morning to noisily pick up the rubbish. Before we got to the USA I looked up the hotel and other people had mentioned the on going workers strike. Each morning the Strikers peacefully walked around the front of the hotel, one"
102,"The location was the best!  We were within walking distance (up to a mile) of pretty much every site we wanted to see.  We had no problem being without a car for a long weekend.  Room was designed well and bed was comfortable. The restaurant bar was a nice amenity, though we only stopped for a beer one of the nights."
103,"Where to start...Picketers out front that confront people as they enter the hotel.  Front desk staff that wasn't familiar with the details of my group reservation (12 rooms).  Inconsistent WiFi.  Terrible customer service after the stay.  There are so many hotels in Chicago, and this hotel just isn't worth the hassle.  We should have stayed at the AC Hotel by Marriott.  It's a much nicer and professional hotel."
104,"This was my first trip to Chicago. I was only there for 2 days and one night, so limited time to sight see.  The Cambria Hotel was nice and very centrally located in the Magnificent Mile area. I was able to walk the area, do some shopping and see the river walk area.  So many things to do and see in Chicago, you really need a couple of days to take it all in."
105,"I plan on staying at another hotel for my for night stay in Chicago, however I found the Cambria and the prices were almost $100 Les. so happy that I change. This hotel is in a perfect location. It is just east of The magnificent Mile on Superior in Michigan. At the corner of the hotel is Saks fifth avenue, Tiffany's, and Neiman Marcus. Very centrally located and within walking distance to everything! I was able to walk to Navy Pier within 30 minutes. The rooms are very large and queen. I stayed in a king suite which has a bedroom and a separate living room with a pull out couch. The furniture was kind of dated. Actually The only furniture in the room was two nightstands in the bedroom. In the living room was the pull-out couch and a chair. Bathroom is kind of on the small side"
106,"As of 9-23-19 workers were striking. There are other affordable options around this area that doesn't require crossing the picket line. Be wary of booking through a nonrefundable website, I wish I knew ahead of time."
107,"Reserved a block of rooms for our friends and we were told each room could be paid for individually, only to be hit with over $2000 on our debit card. We were offered absolutely nothing for our troubles."
108,We had a group of 10 staying at this hotel to attend the Rolling Stones concert.  The rooms were very nice and spacious.  The location was perfect for walking to shopping and dining.  The lobby was so casual and welcoming and was a great place to hang out in the evenings.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The housekeeping staff was on strike outside the hotel during our stay but it was only a little distracting.  It was peaceful at least.  Would definitely recommend this property and consider staying here in the future.
109,"The best part of this hotel is the location. Right next to Gino’s East and one block from Michigan Avenue, you are truly in the heart of Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier with no problem.  My room on the fifth floor was nice sized and the bathroom was huge. No tub but had a very large shower.  Staff was friendly. There was picketing out front which I think was for all of the hotels in Chicago. It was a little uncomfortable coming from a bargaining unit background.  Between the fabulous location, and the nice rooms, I’d gladly stay there next time. Please just settle the union dispute so it does not impact your guests."
110,"This Cambria hotel was a great stay- in an ideal location right in the heart of the city, 10 mins to the ‘L’ metro & within walking of the Millennium park, good restaurants & many museums.   Good staff, gym facilities & breakfast buffet & barista area, but the best thing was the size of the King Size double room we had.  Much roomier than many other hotels I’ve stayed in- this one was particularly generous with a huge comfortable bed & large hi def tv. If there wasn’t so much to see in this great city we could easily have spent all our time in the room!   Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. "
111,Pros... The staff is amazing. Raleigh was incredibly accommodating.  The location is amazing. Room are sizable and can accommodate your entire family.   Only con....The pull out sofa’s mattresses definitely need to be changed out. You can feel the coils.   Thank you!
112,"This hotel is located in a perfect location.  Within walking distance of shopping, great restaurants and many attractions.  The lobby is lovely, the coffee shop and bar are great. The rooms are small, yet nicely decorated. That said there are a few things that need improvement and would prevent us from choosing this hotel again. 1.  The check in--Arrived at 2:30 p.m fully prepare not to be able to check in immediately as the check in time is 3:00 p.m.--Waited patiently enjoyed coffee, drinks and relaxing in the lobby.  Checked back several times rooms still not ready!  Finally at 4:45 p.m. with the patience of 8 people (4 adults& 4 children) wearing thin and a less than pleasant chat with the young man at the check in desk we were finally able to check in.  Reason for delay we"
113,"We had a king room with a sofa.  The room was huge,  clean,  and comfy.  The bathroom was small,  but clean and did the job.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The bell hop Dante and the evening bartender were the best,!!! The location is amazing!!!  Right off Michigan Avenue in the middle of everything.  The only negative was as checking out we saw the price of parking. $62 a day for parking!!!!! What!!!! It isn't  even that costly in NYC.  We would stay again,  but try and find our own parking.  I think there was a garage that was $30 /day near by. "
114,"Reached quite early due to flight timings, and reception (sorry don't recall the name) was kind enough to give the room. Spacious well designed rooms. Great location with near to plenty of shopping and eating options. Will surely stay again next time in Chicago."
115,"My husband and I with our two kids, 8 & 5, stayed here while on our first ever trip to Chicago. We went to a Cubs and White Sox game, Navy Pier, Lincoln Zoo, Millennial Park, and Field Museum. This hotel is a wonderful location with an authentic pizza joint next door. It is only a few blocks from bus stops and train station. We stayed on the fifth floor facing the front, and didn't even really hear or notice the strike picket line at night at all! The service was impeccable and the room was HUGE and bathroom was HUGE! Very Clean, Kid-Friendly, etc! We would definitely stay here again!"
116,"Had the best time here at this hotel. Staff is great, room was nice, and location is prime. The front desk was very friendly and welcoming. The front lobby is very nice and lively. The bar at the hotel lobby is just as nice! My first time in Chicago and they made it that much better! ELIZABETH from the front desk was fantastic. So polite and had some great recommendations. Would come back and ask for her help again. Overall this hotel is a great spot to stay. "
117,"Booked the hotel for two nights...had confirmed reservartion, they even blocked the charge on the credit card. arrived around mid-night due to delayed flight. they told us to take our bags and go to another hotel as they are over booked!!! I mean who does this? this is not an airline where you overbook. even there they offer you an upgrade. additionally the two people at the reception were extremely rude and aggressive. they didn't facilitate us and told us clearly that the hotel only cares about the revenue. we had to go to another hotel and didn't come back as it was extremely inconvenient to check out and check-in again due to our short trip. in short we had pay much more and the hotel didn't do anything to compensate us. the next morning the hotel manager came to apologize"
118,"The location of the Cambria, Magnificent Mile, is highly convenient.  It is located close to everything, yet the street location is quiet.  The room was delightful and clean, with a great view.  Also, the breakfast buffet was excellent."
119,"Was just there this past weekend & would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the amount of money they charge for a room. First, no mirrors in our room except for the dinky one in the bathroom. Second, every time u call room service for something it literally takes hours if they decide to bring it.  Food there sucks & front desk is rude!  They have complimentary small water bottles so I ask for a couple to brew coffee.  After about an hour I get housekeeping to bring coffee & no water. When I ask I’m told hold on let me ask front desk. And didn’t get any. I had to go buy my own.   Here’s the best part....morning of check-out, our alarm clock kept going if every 15 mins starting at 6am. No one set it & we tried to unplug it but the cords were literally locked up in"
120,"Checked in today in a room with a King bed and a ""sofa bed"". The room is advertised as sleeping 3-4 - but the mattress on the sofa ""bed"" is like sleeping directly on metal springs! No support, no padding whatsoever. The floor would be more comfortable. I've slept on poor sofa beds before, but this is by far the worst I have ever experienced. They should be embarrassed to have hotel guests sleep on something like this. When I complained to the front desk, they offered no help whatsoever. I asked if they had any cots instead, and they said it would be an additional charge. REALLY?? When your sofa ""bed"" is like a bed of nails?? They should be paying US to sleep in this room. Terrible!"
121,"What the front desk won't tell you, but once you check in and get to your room you will find a hotel management letter letting you know about Cambria's Union Negotiations that were agreed upon.  However, housekeeping is still striking.  We were awakened by loud voices between at 11:00 p.m. and continued until 3:00 a.m. Our room was located at the front of the hotel.  We were on the 7th floor directly above the entrance. The letter will tell you what you need to do if the noise bothers you.  My Advice, book another hotel in the area, there are plenty. Or, Ask before you book. Otherwise the Hotel is in an excellent location, room and hotel is very clean.  Steps to shopping, Northwestern Campus, Resturants."
122,"Lobby is beautiful and newly renovated. Elevators are efficient and rarely require a wait of more than 1 min.  Rooms are dated, with an odd mix of new and old furnishings that don't quite work together. We were in a king suite that had a large couch and a mini fridge. The TV was large and could be swiveled to be seen by the couch or the bed, but didn't allow any external connections so we were unable to watch netflix or youtube on it.  The bathroom is extremely small vs the rest of the room. Even with two people, it was crowded. You can also very clearly hear others in adjacent rooms and in the hall.  Breakfast is available on site but even with the Expedia VIP $10 off coupon, it wasn't worth it. Selection was limited - toast, scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, pancakes were"
123,"This location is excellent if you are a family looking to see the sights or for anyone looking to shop the Mag Mile. It was priced $50 lower than the other hotels I was looking at and the room was spacious with a seating area separate from the bed - a nice layout for a family of 4. It lost a star for not having a bathtub, which reminds me that I really wish trip advisor would let you do 1/2 stars. I used Spot Hero for a very reasonable overnight garage parking spot in the Northwestern Hospital garage which is right across the street from the hotel. No in and out, but you can get to your car if you need to. Saved $25 compared to overnight parking through the hotel."
124,Came in earlier than expected. Hector was able to help us with a room that was top notch. My fiancé and I will definitely book again soon. Looking forward to our next stay. If we end up stay two nights. Hopefully we can get a good deal.
125,This well located Cambria hotel building used to be an apartment building.  So the rooms are larger than one would typically expect and include a pull out sofa The hotel has a nice workout room.  This seems ideal for the business traveler and families as well  Late check out is limited to 12:30 without a fee
126,"This hotel was horrible. Not clean, over priced, no parking of their own and the hospitality staff and cleaning staff have been on strike for 10 months now. Literally picketing in front of the lobby on the sidewalk."
127,"The hotel room was clean when we checked in.  After staying 2 nights we had to request clean towels.  No one ever emptied the trash, made the bed or brought fresh towels again.  I noticed the first morning the hotel workers were on strike, it definitely effected the service.  I won’t stay there again as long as the workers are striking."
128,The hotel was very clean and classy. The room was spacious and the bed was the best I’ve ever slept on. My wife and I wanted to inquire as to where we could purchase it. The kids really enjoyed the room and have asked repeatedly when we can return. When we return this hotel will be in our top 3.
129,"Located centrally in Chi town's chic neighborhood, the Cambria Hotel offers top quality rooms with excellent amenities. There are plenty of Chicago attractions and shopping in walking distance from this hotel."
130,"I found a letter from the housekeeper's union waiting for me on the desk in my room when I checked in. The topic discussed the in-fighting between the hotel and the union. Highly inappropriate. I turned it into the front desk the first night I checked in.  There are active protesters outside the front door during business hours. The hotel shouldn't be advertising for conferences if the space can't be noise-free.   The roof-top bar shouldn't be advertised if it's for ""special events only."" You can't even go up to look at the view. Also, have the lobby bar menu is flat-out discontinued."
131,"This hotel was perfect for us. Not expensive; not too fancy; clean; just a block off Michigan Avenue at Nieman Marcus and Tiffany's. We walked almost everywhere and the places that were outside of walking distance were available with reasonable cab fare.  There is a hotel worker strike still going on, but it was a peaceful demonstration that was no bother to us."
132,The hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. It had restaurants near by and was easy to get to the train. We stayed in Chicago to go to a Cubs game but also to see the city. This hotel was perfect for our trip and had a nice bar inside the hotel. Just wish the rooftop bar/lounge was available for all guests. You have to have a party reservation to experience it. 
133,"Hotel is in a great location, I toured on foot the majority of the tourist destinations from the hotel.  Surrounded by the main attractions and the Lake is 3,486 steps away confirm by my fitbit.  Great gym."
134,"The location of this hotel allows you to put up with a little more just because it's wonderful!  The room was clean, but nothing to brag about.  A deep cleaning needs to be done.  We used the in room coffee maker to make hot water and the water was brown without any use of coffee.  We reported it and asked for a coupon to buy something downstairs and were given a microwave.  The front desk staff and coffee bar staff did act like they could careless, the valet was nice and the baggage staff was wonderful.  The picket line was out front (but just for a few hours each day) the people were super friendly and couldn't hear them past the front lobby.  This is not a luxury hotel, this is a mid-level hotel."
135,"It is very difficult to get to the hotel in a car.  To pull up to Valet you must enter from Michigan Ave otherwise you have to pull past the hotel and back-up your car.  Also when we were there Protestors greeted us and were a constant.  Last, our room was HOT.  We called down to have someone come and fix it and when we got back from the Cubs game it was still hot and never looked at.  Last, the room design was off - choppy no flow and hard to carry a conversation.  The valet were the nicest to us - everyone else had an attitude like they didn't want to be working there - not worth the money and will never stay at a Choice Hotel again!"
136,"The location to shopping areas and local eateries was wonderful. The staff was friendly, but acted disinterested until Jessica who was both professional and courteous really made the difference in my experience at the front desk. The house keeper was also very pleasant and accommodating during my entire stay."
137,"Front desk staff in the evening were extremely rude and unhelpful with simple requests. I felt like they were bothered by me asking questions about the area and about needing extra water for my room. Location is good, but I paid a lot to stay here and I would not recommend. I will never stay in Cambria again. Also, they have a massive labor dispute with Chicago hotel workers. Apparently, Cambria is the only hotel not to settle the dispute - every other Chicago hotel has. "
138,"Stayed for a business conference that was being held at a nearby Hotel.  Cost was signifcantly lower than conference Hotel and Room was just as nice if not nicer.  Hotel was much smaller and that was nice, because less crowds."
139,"We stayed here at the start of our road trip down to New Orleans at the end of May. The hotel has got the best location. Right off the Magnificent Mile and within very manageable walking distance to all that you could wish to see in Chicago. The rooms are great. Very spacious, clean and tidy. We had a great view of the 360 tower from our room on the 25th floor. This is an ideal hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. The only downside I would add to this and it is minor was that the breakfast offering was a bit stingy for the price. Ours was included as part of our trip so we didn’t pay but certainly wouldn’t have paid for it. The only seating area in which to have your breakfast is in the main hotel lobby as well so that didn’t really sell it to us either. We did have our breakfast"
140,"Although I was not a guest at the Cambria Hotel Chicago Magnificent Mile, I was helped by Dayna (at the reception desk) to get accommodation at another hotel. She walked the extra mile calling multiple times to the reception desk of the other hotel and patiently waited on hold until got somebody to answer. She offered emergency accommodation at the Cambria Hotel in case the other option had not worked. Interestingly, the next day I overheard colleagues of mine sharing their excellent opinion about this hotel. Apparently, my experience was not accidental and Dayna and her colleagues are taking customer care at heart."
141,"Some employees of this hotel have been on strike since September 2018, they have been continuously picketing out front of the hotel, the chant, block the front door, and bang a drum starting early in the morning. I unfortunately need to have a package delivered to me during my stay, even more unfortunately it was time sensitive, due to the strike UPS would not deliver my package, and I would only be able to retrieve it from UPS after my deadline had passed, you would have thought this is A: something they should have mentioned to me when I called the hotel to let them know that I’d have a UPS package arriving, and B: you’d think UPS would know that they won’t deliver to this address. Beyond that the hotel was only okay, the staff wasn’t very friendly or helpful, the rooms"
142,"We had no clue in advance that this is the lone hold out from an apparent hotel workers strike last year. They are still protesting DAILY in front of this location starting at SEVEN AM every day with DRUMS that wake you up no matter what. We were on the top floor 28 and still could not sleep. And there are megaphones. And they yell at  you as you come in. The roof top club above 28 was also a noise issue. Stomping, partying and phone calls to mgmt did not stop the intrusion. So sleep was difficult despite a nice bed and pillows. The room was OK, but especially for the price we would never choose this hotel again with the protesters out there month after month and day after day from 700am until after check in time. Really bad."
143,"Im in Seattle, made reservations for a few days after great reviews. Then I saw online that there is an ongoing active strike.  This would have been important information to know, I confirmed it with the front desk, they were nonchalant about it and didnt give any information, so I canceled my reservation."
144,"So I just checked out of this hotel. The good parts: great location, big rooms. The bad: everything is so old and out of style. Ugly rugs and tiles, sink area is tiny, no control on water pressure, for some strange reason there are stairs in the rooms - which makes it unsafe at night if you need the bathroom, and the worst: the AC units are in the rooms, which makes them noisy. Plus, there is a house keepers strike for 11 months. The strikers stand outside with a big drum and make noise all day. It makes it impossible to sit in the nice lobby. And last, add some vegetables to the breakfast. It's 2019 guys, people want to eat healthy. So, with a nice renovation of the rooms and an agreement with the employees this could turn into a great hotel. Right now it does not deserve 4"
145,"This was a terrible stay! We were told that there was a pool at the hotel when I booked, and there was not! We also received terribly service from the front desk. They were so rude! When we got to the room the phone didn’t work and the beds were not made properly! I would not recommend this hotel at all!"
146,"Let's start with the positive: Great location near hospital Negatives: Extremely loud DRUM banging, chanting and protesting hotel workers. Prior to checking in we were told protests last until 4pm. We proactively asked to switch room to the back of the hotel. Eight hours later there was still loud drumming and chanting. It was after midnight!!! Front desk was ""annoyed"" by ""noisemakers"". I got the feeling I was the noisemaker now.  When I complained I was given ear plugs and sent back to my room. In the morning,management was no help either. We were told our experience at their  establishment wasn't their fault and there wasn't anything they could do. After all we were given ear plugs.  I knew a migraine was inevitable.  We endured that nightmare one night. The Cambria hotel was"
147,"staying more than one night? good luck finding a place to put your clothes. also, watch out for a protest every morning at 7am outside the hotel. they have loud drums. no one told us about that. oh, and the persistent noise the air conditioner makes all night long. good times."
148,The king suite is very comfortable but the bathroom is smaller than you would expect.  They were under a union strike while I was there and I did not know before hand.  Be prepared for no room service while you are there so no way to eat from the hotel after returning from your day of fun in Chicago unless you bring your own food in.
149,"This hotel bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Room was dark and quiet and I slept great.  We were in a junior suite on an upper level floor facing the back.  No view, but very quiet.  Room had an odd feature - it looks like it was recently renovated and they removed a sink outside the bathroom but left the cutout and towel hooks on the wall.  Location is great - next to Northwestern and two blocks off Michigan Ave.  Protesters were there during our stay, but they did not bother us."
150,The hotel workers are on strike.  They begin their protests every morning at 7 and they continue all day.  Hotel will not inform you when booking.  It soured what should have been a really fun weekend away.
151,"My husband and I stayed here for eleven nights during a family holiday/reunion trip before Easter. We decided to ignore the negative reviews about the industrial action because of the great location and the otherwise good comments about the rooms and amenities. The hotel is situated just off the Magnificent Mile, a short walk from the department stores, restaurants, bus stops, etc. At check-in the reception staff were friendly and candid about the noise from the strikers outside the lobby every day and asked if we would like to stay in a quiet room on the other side of the hotel ''with no view''. We accepted the offer and were delighted to be allocated a mini suite with two large windows looking up at the John Hancock Tower. We also had a large leisure area with sofa and coffee"
152,"Great place to come back to after a long day of Chicago fun and food! We had a suite with king bed and sleeper sofa. Each of these 'rooms' had their own TV which worked out great for us. Was also thankful for the clean, nice bath room. Advice: Ignore the protesters...the hotel with its location, service, price and cleanliness is worth it."
153,"Labor strike started at 7:00 in the morning. Employees screaming, banging drums and shouting abuse at anyone walking into or out of the hotel. Don’t waste your money. It’s a total joke. Completely ridiculous. Go literally anywhere else. "
154,This is a beautiful hotel right off of Michigan Ave and Superior next door to Gino's East Pizza.  The room was beaitifully decorated and had a nice Sasmsung TV ans a awesome bathroom.  The lobby personel were veery friendly and efficient.  The lobby has a bar and a food and coffee concession.  I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again.
155,"The location of this hotel was excellent for what we were doing.  We were able to walk everywhere in the city, and the train (L) station was close for the times we needed it.  There was a strike going on that we were unaware of until we checked in.  It didn't seem to effect the service we received.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone."
156,"Great staff, (thank you Jessica and company), ideally located in the heart of the city, helpful and friendly staff.  The hotel was clean (not a speck of dust),easily walkable for tourists. The bed was comfortable, I had a great view of the city (room 502) and the price for  the location was more than reasonable.  I will return to Chicago soon and Cambria Hotel Magnificent Mile will be my go to hotel when I am there!  I highly recommend it."
157,"My two friends and I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and shared a room. My two friends were in a double bed and I was in a sofa bed. The room was comfortable and clean - however, I was cold in the sofa bed and twice requested another blanket from reception staff - I was told this would be brought to our room - this never materialised. I then requested a blanket from the chamber staff and was advised this could be obtained from the reception staff - I advised I had already tried this and the chamber maid said she would get a blanket - again this never materialised. We also on several occasions requested enough tea, coffee, water, etc. for 3 people as only 2 had been catered for in our room. We were told by reception staff 'it is complimentary you know' - well of course"
158,"Our room was larger than expected upon arrival. Very clean room, and spacious bathrooms. However, the protests for higher wages disrupted our morning. Restaurants nearby. Overall a modern design with friendly and efficient staff."
159,"Hotel was fine but housekeepers were on strike. Even though I asked for a quiet room and had to stay up late, they put me at the front. Was awoken by strikers with drums and bullhorns at 7:15 AM, making it impossible to sleep. They moved me to a room in the back the second night, which was fine, but it is absolutely ridiculous to put guests in rooms where you know they will not be subjected to drums and bullhorns early in the morning. "
160,"Hotel- Kimpton Allegro (Chicago, IL) Date- 11/6 – 11/8 (2 nights) Overall: 3/5. Good/Average. Overall, this was a fair experience, for a stay during the pandemic. The staff members we interacted with were pleasant, and the room we ultimately received met all expectations for the brand.  Rewards Club Recognition- 4/5. Above average. Although we were not verbally thanked for our loyalty, we were given a branded bag containing a chocolate bar, a bag of bbq chips, some skittles, and two waters. We were not given welcome amenity points, and we had to ask to get the usual $10 Raid-the-Bar credit. Our room was upgraded initially to a ‘King Premier’ room. Please note that this property is leaving the Kimpton chain, and the usual amenity offerings are not being provided.  Staff- 4/5."
161,"We stayed there because our son was getting married in the city. We had a group who stayed and I have to say that the employees went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay! Our group kind of took over the lobby of the hotel throughout the weekend and never felt like so comfortable! They allowed us to continue the celebration, without any comments or concerns. With this whole pandemic putting a damper on the wedding, it was wonderful that they were so accommodating! Thanks again!"
162,"We had our wedding block for our guests and families during covid19 at hotel allegro. The staff is beyond extraordinary. They went out of there way to help with everything we needed. From allowing dogs to arranging photo shoots for our wedding party. I cannot recommend this place enough! Fantasy is probably the best most patient person on the planet. She made this step of our wedding stress free.  Also, the hotel is just gorgeous! Take a moment to look at all the detail in this fabulous building!"
163,room I had was smaller than I expect but didnt bother me as much. The customer service was phenomenal Micheal and Ben were great the hotel time. They really brought a welcoming vibe which was awesome. Definitely will be staying here again!
164,"Had a great stay for 4 nights - comfy beds, Renovated suite with wonderful bathroom, Very accommodating staff. Really enjoyed the use of free bikes provided by the hotel, along with bike lock and helmet too! Best perk!"
165,"We enjoyed this hotel but a few things we did not like. There is no WiFi at all, room was very small, bathroom was extremely small, great water pressure and shower temp was hot, sink water pressure hot, facet too close to sink to wash hands, need better shower curtain to not wet floor, need to renovate the wallpaper, and upholstery on bed, need to clean/wash carpet. Walls were thin. Could hear the people next door. Due to COVID restrictions, we were able to text the front desk and get fresh towels. Also they had a really NICE Prosecco Hour. Lobby was depicted as pictured as well as the entrance. Starbucks is located next door for a quick coffee pick up. Overall stay was good."
166,"The room was very small. None of the amenities were available during our visit. No breakfast was offered, not even continental. To add insult to injury we were charged a $100 smoking fee, neither my husband nor I smoke."
167,Stayed here with my family during the holidays. The weather was beautiful and the hotels location made it perfect for us to walk to christkindlmart and millennium park. The hotel had some nice touches and we enjoyed room service and their cocktail hour.   Staff was great and the room was well appointed. We stayed in a suite to give our family of 3 some room to spread out. It was a great vacation!
168,"I decided to take a last minute trip to Chicago and needed a hotel. I found Hotel Allegro at a great price. The hotel was beautifully decorated in the art deco style. The room was on the smaller side but it was perfect for me since I was traveling solo. There is also a happy hour from 5-6 daily, where you can get you Prosecco fix. It is centrally located near plenty of great restaurants and shopping. Leah R. at the front desk was AMAZING and was always happy to answer my questions and drop recommendations for some of her favorite nearby spots. If i am ever in Chicago again, I would definitely stay at this hotel."
169,"I will be honest and say I had been avoiding IHG properties for a little while due to an experience at a property in Cherry Hill, NJ.  So needless to say, my company booked this property and I was pleasantly surprised.  It is well located.  Many restaurants and transportation are just steps away (with a restaurant in the lobby).  You can actually come straight here from O’Hare as the Blue line stops a block away.  This by no means is a ultra-luxury hotel.  However, for a renovated prewar building, it is nice enough.  They make up for it in the service.  The customer service is wonderful.  I arrived super early and was granted early check-in with a kind smile.  The elevator was clean, albeit not as secure as I would have wanted for a city hotel (meaning, you don’t need key card"
170,My friends and I stayed here for a short reunion trip. It was fun and swanky. We really enjoyed returning from a long day in the city to free champagne (5pm-6pm everyday). The staff was very friendly and the beds are super comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!!
171,"Rooms were nice, common spaces are beautiful, and the staff is incredibly friendly. Find Leah and tell her hi, she's one of the best!  Check out the champagne happy hour from 5 to 6 also. Free unlimited champagne and great company!"
172,"Our room was on the small side with furnishings that are either weird or artsy depending on your point of view. In addition to the very comfortable bed our room had a credenza containing the refrigerator/minibar and safe, a desk and a couple of small pouffes for seating. A small table and comfy chair would have been a nice touch but there wasn't space.  As others have noted, the walls are rather thin, so keep it down!  Like the bedroom, the bathroom was also compact. Disappointingly in this day and age, it still had a tub rather than a walk-in shower.  Everything was clean and worked, so no complaints there. I was a little surprised by the lack of USB outlets. I also didn't care for the main room light which was as charmless as an old fluorescent tube.  Kimptons pride themselves"
173,"I used points to stay here in December. I had minibar credit but noticed a random unidentified charge of almost $60 on my credit card from this property. I called to inquire about the bill (which I never received at checkout), and when it was sent the charge was magically removed. Note, I hadn't asked them to do this, I just wanted to see what I was being charged for. Seems they knew it was bogus without even having to ask... Hmm, why would that be? Check your bill."
174,Not a luxury hotel but a great price value. My rate was 130/night for a downtown Chicago hotel. Adjacent to the EL so convenient transportation links. Close to Art instiitute and Millenium Park. Attractive decor in lobbies. Rooms are small and only chair was a desk chair. No on room coffee service. But otherwise a nice comfortable room. Lots of walkable restaurants.
175,"Hotel is located amazingly in the middle of The Loop area. One can easily walk to visit any sights in the area. Lobby and bar area have a very impressive art-deco design and seem to have been recently renovated. The rooms, unfortunately, are a bit outdated and small - the style isn't really in the line with that of the rest of the hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Porters, however, were not very helpful with luggage and ordering a taxi. Didn't have the chance to check-out the restaurant, but it seemed busy at all times."
176,"Location is good, no complains at all They have no room service and when I asked they told me that Uber Eat was available or take out from the Hotel Restaurant. Not the answer you want to hear after a long day. No coffee maker in the room 30% of the fitness center working machines weren’t working. For sure I am not going back to this hotel"
177,"It was our second time at this hotel. We stayed one night. Loved the decor and the social hour (they had rose for Valentine’s weekend and hot cider), the lobby has cozy places to sit and chat with friends. We arrived in the morning, but they had a room available and checked us in right away, which was really nice. The room was comfortable. We would definitely stay there again."
178,"I stay here frequently for business. Arrived at the hotel quite late at night. Was greeted warmly at check in by Leah. Recognizing I was dead on my feet, she managed to locate late night caffeine for me and I was in my room within minutes.   Grabbed my complimentary coffee while checking out the next morning and was on my way to meetings. Lovely property, friendly staff. Easy stay. They also have a great restaurant. "
179,"Terrible service from the front desk when there is a problem. Stayed here multiple times for work and now they are using my email and phone number for other guests. First they blamed it on the system and said any McCarthy that stays there will get assigned my personal info. Next, night manager said the guest had to have provided my personal information even though they couldn’t possibly know it unless they stole my identity and then the manager assured me the guest did not provide the information when I asked if I should call the police. Was told twice (a month apart) that my personal info was deleted from this strangers‘ reservation. Now being told to call back for a third time and talk to a manager. Worried that personal data is not safe when staying here. The rooms are small"
180,After a long day and struggle to get downtown Leah and Nick made my day when I checked in !! Wonderful smiles and warm welcome. The complimentary champagne was a bonus !!  Room is decent size for Chicago and everything was clean. 
181,Staying at Kimpton Hotel Allegro has been such a wonderful experience! The customer service here is exceptional and the employees are especially nice to talk to. Shout out to Paige for making our stay worthwhile!
182,"Had a blast at this hotel, lobby is beautiful and staff has been extra friendly to us. Would definitely come again, especially for the happy hour from 5-6. Thank you to Leah for treating us extra well during our stay."
183,"Was here on business, their Prosecco hour makes this the best hotel ever! Leah was the best out of everyone, and nick as well, we were here with a group and they treated us better than any other hotel! Thanks! "
184,"All around great stay. Be sure to see the concierge, David. He is dedicated to service and thoughtful care during your stay. All staff is kind, friendly and the hotel has a great vibe. Close to so many sites!"
185,This hotel is incredible!  It has a historic feel but is super clean and gorgeous.  We had our wedding here and can't recommend Paige enough to help book and plan your event.  The staff is amazing and highly recommend this hotel.  Great location and food too!
186,"I was bummed I was going to be in Chicago for work on my birthday and not have anything special to do. Lucy at the bar made me feel so at home and sang me “happy birthday.” The next day when I got back from work, there was a piece of cake with a note that a “little bird” told them it was my birthday. Shoutout to Lucy, David,Leah, Paige and everyone at Hotel Allegro for making my stay so incredible. This is not a birthday I will be forgetting. "
187,The room was great and the service was excellent.   The bar was fun with awesome happy your deals and interesting cocktails.  Bathroom in the room was very large and comfortable.  Location downtown is superb and easily walkable to many attractions.  Will stay again.
188,The night manager Artuto made my visit so wonderful. He took extra time to make sure I had a great room and then sent me additional amenities! I will be returning tp the Kimpton everytime I am in Chicago. The coffee bar every morning was great. Cant wait to come back and experience the cocktail hour.
189,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Allegro for a few nights and were very pleased with our experience there. Very clean and comfortable room, friendly staff, nice fitness center and within walking distance to most of everything touristy. The free coffee and hot chocolate bar in the lobby was a nice touch too. Only negative was the thin walls, but that's really only a minor detail that did not bother us much."
190,"We decided to go to Chicago for our anniversary and didn't really want to spend a lot of money.  The hotel room was nice, clean, and the people were very friendly. Parking was expensive and we did have some issues with parking but got everything figured out (hard to find the car on Sunday because the parking garage wasn't actually open on Sundays so we had to go to a  different entrance).  "
191,"The Allegro proved a pleasant surprise during my last visit to Chicago. I brought my team of 5 up for business meetings and we experienced a beautiful boutique hotel with a tremendous staff. They were quick to serve us and took time to answer any questions we might have regarding all Chicago has to offer. One employee, Rubie, stood out as she went out of her way to ensure my staff and I were satisfied. Her food suggestions turned out to be just what we wanted during our stay. Thanks Allegro and Thanks Rubie!"
192,This was a trip for a group of 8 people. Busy time of year and the hotel staff was spot on perfect. The set up was easy and well organized. We all had a good time and I will be going back to this location in the future. 
193,"I surprised my wife with a night in  Chicago and a theater show. We were very amazed how beautifully decorated the room was. The entire hotel was amazing! Some have stated the rooms are small, we found it comfortable and just fine. Front desk service was absolutely phenomenal.  East check in and helpful explaining things. Very convenient to the Cadillac Palace Theater and short  walk to State St. and Michigan Ave. "
194,We have stayed here multiple times and have always had a great stay. The staff is great and usually very accommodating.  The hotel is very modern and has a great vibe.  The best part is that they do a Prosecco happy hour every day for hotel guest.  You just have to show them your room key.  They also have kids games and kids goody bags at the front desk.  The only downside is there is no pool and rooms are tight.  Other than that it is a great hotel!
195,Beautiful Hotel-Front Desk personnel were fantastic and professional! I needed an upgraded room because my mom and niece came for a surprise visit!!!  Morning coffee and evening cocktails were spot on! We absolutely loved the decor!
196,"I stayed at the Kimpton Hotel Allegro this past weekend for my friend's 30th birthday! The staff was incredible! Upon checking in, Leah and David were SO helpful and informative. Their pleasantness made me forget all about our delayed flights and traveling discomfort. Our room was clean and beautiful as was the hotel lobby. Definitely a lot of beautiful backdrops for great pictures! Leah, David, and Paige were so helpful, bringing us whatever we needed during our stay and checking in on us to make sure we were having a great time. They also provided us with recommendations for dinner and fun things to do in the city! The hotel has a free prosecco happy hour every night, which allows you to mingle with other guests as well as the staff. I enjoyed staying at the Kimpton Allegro,"
197,"We hosted about 25 rooms for our NYE wedding this past week and working with the whole Allegro team was SO easy. Zero complaints.  Leading up to the event they were always accommodating, helpful, and responsive. We needed a few things while we were staying there at the last minute and everyone was so easy to work with and helped make our experience great. The amenities are amazing, the area is great, and that lobby cannot be beat.  It's always clean, comfortable, and affordable.  My absolute favorite.  Who doesn't love a free prosecco happy hour!?"
198,"Every time I am at Hotel Allegro, David and Paige are the warmest people that always greet me first. Whenever I am visiting or passing through to do work in the beautiful lobby, I have another good experience. Highly recommend for anyone staying in the Downtown Loop area."
199,"In the Loop, close to Clarke and Lake El, this hotel is central. Theatres nearby, a short walk to the art Institute and north towards the Magnificent Mile. I chose it for the convenience of the Ogilvie Transport Centre and the blue line for getting ot the airport at the end of the stay and of course being in the centre of Chicago.  It has a good spacious lobby, where free hot drinks are served in the morning and Prosecco or mulled cider fo an hour early evening, sufficient (and beautiful art deco lifts) and reasonably sized rooms.  There were some inconveniences: the room with two people, suitcases and warm weather clothing quickly became a little cramped. Very little hanging space and not enough room for suitcases meant we had to work round each other.  There were not coffee"
200,We were staying at the Allegro for a night in the city to celebrate my friends birthday. We were greeted at the front desk by Deja Tate. She was incredibly helpful and gave us suggestions of places to go in the city as we are not from the area. We ended up going to one of her suggestions and had such a fun night. She also gave us a late check out because we got back to the hotel late. She made our experience amazing and we definitely will be back!
201,"Stayed for a night to catch a show at the theater next door. Cozy and fun rooms had a great 1920s vibe going on with ultra comfy beds and the old wooden window frames on the other side of the modern glass. Had great staff, fast checkin/out, can’t wait to go back!"
202,"I’ve stayed at Kimpton Hotel Allegro couple of times during my business trip to Chicago, I strongly recommend. The hotel  kept the old architectural style, very clean and located close to theaters and restaurants, with a Starbucks next to the hotel. They don’t provide free internet"
203,Phantom was in town and it couldn't have been more convenient being right next door. Beds and pillows were uber comfy. No negatives at all here. Highly recommended and cannot wait for another visit. Also this was our first stay here.
204,"Such a beautiful hotel inside and out. Finely decorated yet welcoming. Staff was great, bed was Amazingly comfortable! Location perfect with nearby public parking less expensive than hotel parking. Price unbelievable for Chicago. Will definitely stay here again!!"
205,"First time we stayed here. I liked the location and atmosphere.  People were excellent to work with. Very close to the Cadillac Palace theater, 312 restaurant and Kindle Mart. Many pluses to stay here. Did find bathroom to be smaller than would like and the bathroom vent did not clear humidity very well"
206,"Our stay at this hotel was wonderful.  Just next to the Theater District, this hotel is well situated for guests who attend operas or like to take in a good show.  The lobby is grand, both in size and in styling. Our check in experience was very good. The line to check in was small, and the front desk staff did a great job making each guest feel valued while working efficiently to serve everybody. (Darius was the representative with whom we both checked in and out). I was especially impressed with Leah and Page, both of whom are truly model employees. I couldn't help but notice during the morning coffee just how kind and engaging these two ladies were in particular. Kudos to each of these three representatives; they are true assets to the hotel! The room we were assigned was a"
207,The hotel and staff were great I loved the text msg they do it’s very convenient the room could probably be a little more sound proof but glad it’s a dog friendly hotel!! Didn’t like the fact I booked with a reservationists and the hotel didn’t see the same thing I booked so I got doubled charged for valet hotel is located in a great place to walk everywhere
208,"I was going to Chicago to see Phantom of the Opera at the Cadillac Palace Theater, and wanted a hotel close by. The Kimpton Hotel Allegro is right next door. It's a beautiful hotel, clean, the woman I spoke to at the desk when I checked in was friendly and even checked in on us after we had got to our room to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed. The price for our room was more than generous for such a nice hotel and a perfect location. I would happily stay there again."
209,Hotel was very nicely decorated for the holidays and we showed up just in time for their Saturday happy hour which was nice . Lots of people gathered and felt very festive . Our room had no view but were told we would have one so it was disappointing.  The room was small and so was the bathroom . They do send you a text to see how everything is going and I shared my concern but nobody responded . Other than this the hotel is close to a lot of main attractions Chicago has to offer . I love kimpton properties but this one was just ok . 
210,"I booked this hotel for my birthday getaway with my sister and I'm very pleased with my choice. We came early to the hotel to see if we could check in early, they said our room wasn't available yet, but they checked our bags so we didn't have to carry them around while we walked. Pleasantly surprised by that. We got a room on the 19 floor, good view, nice people at check in. My favorite part of my stay was the bartenders at the hotel bar. They knew how to make every drink that was being ordered, big plus they were super friendly and gave me a free drink because it was my birthday!!  I will definitely be staying at this hotel the next time I'm in Chicago. Good price for the room, lots of accommodations and great location. Walking distance to everything downtown."
211,The hotel is chic and fun. The food is good. The meeting rooms are flexible. Some are on different levels and not the easiest flow. Sleeping rooms could use a coffee maker. But the staff is remarkable.
212,"Had a good stay here. Within 2-3 blocks of the Goodman, next door to the Palace and close to many good restaurants. Macy’s just down the street. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. It’s a beautiful hotel- historic and full of style. The room had all the amenities that we needed. It was a little small but very comfortable and a great price! We will definitely keep this hotel in mind especially when we come for a theater performance !"
213,Stayed one night for our annual trip to see A Christmas Carol at the Goodman. Within walking distance to all the theaters. Hotel is very clean and a beautiful lobby area. Enjoyed the happy hour with hot bourbon spiced cider! Room was small but bed was super comfy and bathroom had all updated fixtures. Shower pressure was awesome! Will definitely be recommending this hotel to family and friends. Thanks again Kimpton for another fantastic stay!
214,"We are pretty faithful to the Hotel Monaco .  This time, however, I thought ""Why not try the Allegro?""  The Allegro is always a bit cheaper than the other two Kimptons, so we decided to try it.   The short story is that I thought it was great. I still like the Monaco better, but I think the Allegro is a great option.  I actually prefer the location, it's much closer to the Fulton Market restaurants and a quick trip on public transport to the United Center.  The rooms are quite a bit smaller and the noise from the hallway is pretty poor.  I know, they will say ""it's an old building"".  But honestly, I don't know if the problem is the doors or the walls, or both.  When in the hallways, you can hear convos in the room.  When in the room you can hear convos in the hallways.  It's"
215,Amazing meal served at wedding and guests still rave about it.  Paige is wonderful to work with.  Valet guys--the best!  We experienced a rainy day wedding and Marvin D--went above and beyond helping us!  Thank you.  
216,"This hotel is a very nice clean place to rest your tired body. But the staff is what makes the stay memorable. The front desk people: Paige, Leah and Deva were very helpful and very friendly. I also want to mention the two concierges (sorry guys I didn’t get your names) were very knowledgeable and helpful. These are the people that make your stay memorable and to have the desire to want to return to this hotel."
217,"I stayed in the hotel for a wonderful weekend in Chicago. It was an absolutely beautiful hotel, nice staff and comfortable bed. The rooms are a bit small and there is no room service or pool but other than that a nearly perfect experience."
218,Our room was beautiful and the staff was extremely helpful! Very clean and well stocked room with all we needed and more. We used the valet services and would do so again! The view and location was perfect for all the activities we had planned! Within walking distance of many of the theaters as well as shopping and ChriskindlMarket!
219,"I loved almost everything about this hotel.   Its modern interpretation of the Art Deco motif is masterfully realized. My room featured beautiful art, the bedding was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom, although a tad on the small side, featured high quality Atelier Bloem products and soft, plush towels.   The front desk staff, including Leah, went out of their way to ensure that I was comfortable. And I greatly appreciated the coffee in the lobby each morning. What’s more, I never had to wait long for an elevator.   There’s a wonderful electric, festive, big-city vibe about this place.    I arrived at the hotel a bit before check-in time, and was told that my room was available, but there’d be a $30 early check-in fee if I didn’t want to wait. I was exhausted from my"
220,"I know this review is pretty late but I wanted to let you guys know I had a great time at this hotel beautiful room. I love the social hour and most important Leah at the front desk, she has a contagious personality. Definitely will be booking again."
221,I was here for business but it was a short sweet and simple. Leah at front desk checked me in with smiles and giggles had me blushing the whole time we were talking. I love the vibes n the entry keep it up!
222,"My sister and I came in to town for a quick girls trip and had a fabulous stay at the Allegro!  We were able to get an early check-in, Todd was very helpful!  Our room was super trendy and clean!  We enjoyed their complimentary champagne social before we headed out for dinner and a concert.  We enjoyed a great conversation with Daja and Bryant who shared great information about the hotel's history!  Definitely will book again for another trip to Chicago!"
223,"During my stay at the Allegro, I have asked the front desk 3 times, to remove a dead bird outside my window.  The bird is still there. This is just not acceptable.  The dead bird is on the fire escape and should be easy to get to so I am not sure this situation has not been addressed.   "
224,"We needed an overnight stay with an affordable price. I use Travelzoo to find clearance travel stuff. Travelzoo had this hotel for $99. Parking with that price was $45. A steal in Chicago! Also the location of this hotel cannot be beat. It is a really good location. We walked to everything that we wanted to do.  First if you arrive with a car, there is no driveway at all for this hotel. I managed to find curb space in front of the hotel. But I have a small car so this can be challenging. The valet took our car away and that was no problem. Check in was easy and the agent was professional.   Our room was nice. Kimptons have unusual room decor. The room was very clean.  But the bathroom was too small. The vanity is only 16 inches wide. Very difficult to use the sink with the"
225,We stayed here on our first trip to Chicago. It is in a very good location and made it easy to get wherever we wanted to go. The staff was very helpful and attentive. They had all the amenities we needed and an awesome evening Prosecco and cider hour each evening. We would definitely recommend the allegro to others!
226,Stayed at this hotel in early November to visit my brother . The hotel itself is lovely but the staff where very rude. Not very helpful. If you want to stay at a hotel that looks great but treats you badly this is the place for you.
227,"This is a very old hotel with a number of art deco touches and that may appeal to some, but, for me, it wasn't enough to offset the many things that were lacking in a typical business hotel.  I stayed here with colleagues, one of whom was enthusiastic about staying here and recommended it.  As a result, I didn't bother doing any research about the place before booking my room.  I know that management will probably respond with ""well, it's a very old hotel,"" but it's advertised as ""vintage meets modern"" so I don't think that will serve.  I'll start with the negatives and then cover the positives.  First off, my room not only didn't have a closet, it didn't have a wardrobe or even a coat hook! Had to throw my winter jacket over the desk chair and keep my shirts folded in the"
228,"This is a little belated, but after a visit to the Kimpton Allegro the end of October for the Society for Neuroscience meeting, I would NOT recommend this hotel. My co-worker, SC, had her wallet stolen out of her purse, in the lobby, during the complimentary proseco happy hour. The manager, Todd, was incredibly rude, demeaning and dismissive about the incident. He really couldn't have cared less that SC was stuck, 600 miles away from home, without any money or identification. SC had a very clear timeline because of Uber receipts and credit card activity, making it only possible that the wallet was stolen in the lobby, in clear view of at least 3 security cameras. At first she was told the table where we were sitting was out of view of the cameras. Then she was told they could"
229,"Fabulous staff, lovely rooms with the best beds in town, perfect location. . . . What's not to love? Oh, and reasonable prices. I don't stay anywhere else in Chicago. Very easy access to public transportation. If you don't have a coffee pot in your room, ask and they'll bring you one. Thanks, David!"
230,"As a former SPG platinum, I have yet to experience service that has wowed me like SPG used to do - but I have now found my place.  The Kimpton is a beautiful space with friendly staff.  Leah was a delight at the front desk and the room was modern and clean. I love the yoga mats in the room and sipping the complimentary bubbles in the cozy lobby at the happy hour.  Definitely recommend this spot."
231,"One of my favorite hotels in the Chicago area, the design is gorgeous and the rooms are quiet and comfortable. The fitness center has a wide variety of options including a Peloton bike which was fun to try. Also any hotel with a Prosecco hour every night is a winner in my book. Highly recommend this hotel to those coming to Chicago for work or pleasure."
232,"Decent hotel but how you don’t have bottled water for purchase in your lobby is extremely annoying and inconvenient. This is my 2nd visit (only hotel in Chicago my company allows us to stay at) and I come back to the hotel late at night every evening and nothing is open in the vicinity. I can either: bring a glass or two of water up to my room from the lobby which is difficult with bags, squeeze my way into the bar and purchase one for $4 or purchase one in room for $6 for which our company audits us. Please offer water bottled water in your lobby to grab and go."
233,"This hotel was gorgeous. Yes the valet is a little overpriced, but the staff was on point and so friendly. We absolute loved the fact that they allowed our furry companions without a fee! They even had a doggy bag waiting!  As for the room, there are a few extras that I wish were available such as an empty fridge, a microwave and some better pillows. The bed wasn’t the most comfortable compared to other hotels.  Overall it was great, just a few things that we could have used."
234,He had a great stay at Hotel Alegro. The entire staff was fabulous and attentive. Fun Prosecco reception at 5 pm in upbeat bar/lounge area. Great location in the loop and close to lots of attractions and great restaurants. Rooms were classy with all the amenities. We love all Kimpton properties.
235,"Can’t recommend highly enough. Great room, wonderful amenities. Fitness room well-equipped and clean. Restaurant was terrific. Fantastic location. Particularly appreciate Leah who checked me in and paid a lot of attention toward making sure my stay was incredible. Friendly staff, gorgeous property and décor."
236,"I stay at Kimpton properties a lot when I travel for work and my experience with the Allegro was very much in line with other Kimptons - service is great, location is usually good, and, under the guise of “boutique,” there are usually strange things about the rooms that can just make them difficult or uncomfortable. At the Allegro, it was the lighting. The room was very small, which is not unusual for city hotels, and my first room looked straight out to a brick wall only a few feet away. The walls were covered in dark blue wall paper and the only lights were a glare-y ceiling fixture and two very dim wall sconces on either side of the bed. I asked for another room, and was put in almost the same room but on a higher floor so I at least had some daylight in the morning. The"
237,"The stay was short sweet and great. The room was great had a delightful smell as well. The check in was smooth and quick, Leah greeted us with a friendly smile and a warm welcome very friendly. The concierge Josh was great gave great directions."
238,"Great location, beautiful property. Two things for a business traveler... After a long narrowing travel day, coming to a place where businesses surrounding are mostly closed + the restaurant not having room service is a minus. Second, the room had a dirty bath towel that either had make-up stains that was kind of gross to deal with it and made me question the hygienic conditions!"
239,"From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted with smiles - Rubie at the desk made me Feel comfortable and eddies I was truly impressed, I checked in around 515 doing wine hour, there was a bellman standing and he was extremely friendly I forget his name but he surprised me with a bottle of champagne to my room because I had such a crazy day trying to get their awesome awesome service.… I got a follow up call later on from Deja, just checking on me and making sure that all was OK, she seemed genuine and sincere.  the hotel Decour was very relaxing. 515 during wine hour, there was a bellman standing and he was extremely friendly I forget his name but he surprised me with a bottle of champagne to my room because I had such a crazy day trying to get there awesome awesome"
240,GSA Kay was very helpful in helping us get a room. Bellman Ishmael was very helpful and pleasant. The room was a nice size and that there was a refrigerator in the room. We were happy with the room and would love to visit again. 
241,"It's a bit dizzying how many hands through which the Ambassador has passed since it's PUBLIC CHICAGO rebranding nearly ten years ago.  The turnover rate of the hotel employees was high and the service was varied, though always well intended.    Hopefully, with the Hyatt brand inheriting the property, there will be consistency and believe me when I say that this is the consistency the property has always deserved.  The property itself is gorgeous with a stunning chandelier in the lobby and modern decor.  My favorite room layout is the one bedroom, which feels more like an apartment than the loft. The decor is the only thing that's been changed and it feels like a downgrade from a sexy hotel to a suburban mom decorated hotel.  Ambassador used to be a great place to have a date,"
242,Good for what we needed which was a night out in the Old town bar area. Easy walk to and from lots of great bars. The building and room were a bit older but still clean enough. Might not do an extended stay but it was a clean room in a great location 
243,"We were heading to a concert at the Aragon ballroom and decided to try this hotel out. Fantastic, great service, clean rooms and very modern. Low beds but overall very comfortable. Located greatly near 3 arts cafe. Nice bar downstairs and breakfast was semi self service. All in all a great experience. "
244,I received excellent service from Kay she was very professional when I needed assistants and very nice and caring.she has an outstanding personalty and very fun to talk to I most definitely will be visiting again
245,The hotel was beautiful with very great staff to go with it. The only problem i had at this lovely place was with paying for a room i did not intend on staying in. I was charged more money not aware of the price told to me after already i booked.
246,Checked in to this hotel last week from out of town and the clerk Kenya have a awesome attitude and very helpful. Any questions I asked she was able to answer instead of telling me she don't know. Thanks again
247,"Stayed in this hotel for NBA ALL STAR WEEKEND. Overall my stay was great. The hotel has warm cozy feeling vibe the minute you step in. I had a superior queen room which I found a little too small for my liking. The location is great! 3 mins walk from the Clark/Division subway station. Walking distance from the Michigan Ave (Magnificient Mile)   The only cons during my stay was the noisy hotel guests! There was one couple who fought during the night of Valentines Day and the following Saturday night. I had to go shut them out on both nights. Also on Sunday night, another guest was playing loud music. Lets say that I didnt get much sleep during my stay! Also the heating fan was very loud! It would stop and go back on randomly :/   PROS: Friendly staff and very comfortable bed! "
248,"This is probably the best hotel in North America, not just because of the location and the facility, it's also because of the culture the staff itself offers and promotes, the hotel front desk has super stars like Ms Kay, who go an extra mile in making up your day even though they don't have to do it. The night supervisor Mr. Kenny is kind and understanding and the bar tender Mr. Timmon is a Rockstar mix master, the lobby and the elevator have lively classic blues playing and its truly a miracle how the staff keeps the place sparkling clean and warm and never gives you a feeling of being away from home. This hotel has everything right, the bedding, the food, the bar and the music but most of all, the people. Ehind all this are the embodiment of perfection, kindness, compassion,"
249,"This was our first trip to Chicago! We stayed at the Ambassador and enjoyed our stay! Beautiful hotel with a very cozy feel. Great breakfast in the hotel and excellent service. There is also a cozy bar. Close to shopping and restaurants ,the Valet service is also excellent there!  Any request is handled with a smile. I highly recommend The Ambassador!"
250,"While checking in, my husband and I witness and interaction between a front desk clerk and a disgruntled guest. He was being a complete jerk, slamming things down on the desk and calling the clerk out of her name. I think her name is Kay stayed calm and very respectful, offering to help the guest solve his issue. Not once did she raise her voice or sound angry( I was angry for her). She remained professional and friendly. My husband said he was going to offer her a job. We work in the public sector and we have never seen anyone handle that situation with such finesse."
251,I would like to send this review out to the Front Desk staff especially Miss Kenya. Everyone was friendly and professional but her attentiveness to any detail was outstanding. Not only to myself but to my work colleagues. And I wanted to bring her work ethic to your attention.   I definitely will return and recommend staying there to my other colleagues.  
252,"I picked this hotel as a weekend getaway for my girlfriend and I, and it was wonderful!  The front desk lady Kay (nice on the eyes by the way) was very professional. The service was top notch, from check in to check out, I cannot express what this weekend meant to us. We felt like royalty! The hotel was beautiful, the room was gorgeous and clean and the service was excellent.  We were just amazed at how wonderful Kay was, and the rest of the staff, but Kay stood out the braids-maid that's looking better than the bride!  Statuesque.  I have absolutely fallen in love with this hotel and yes, yes, yes, yes, we will be back!"
253,"Kay and the rest of the staff were friendly and extremely helpful from the moment we checked in through departure. The location is great, walking distance to the best the city has to offer. Will definitely return on a future visit!"
254,"Every aspect of this hotel was wonderful during our stay. We chose this hotel for our wedding so we could have a central location for our rehearsal dinner and wedding in the city. From the very beginning Maya Dykema was very warm and accommodating. She made sure everything we needed was provided and the hotel employees were kind and prompt with their service. She was absolutely terrific to work with. Our family stayed here as well and they were impressed with how much the hotel went out of their way to make us feel at home. The service was perfect. That coupled with how beautiful this hotel is makes this place the perfect hotel in the city, regardless of what you're looking for."
255,"I live in the neighborhood and had to stay overnight at a hotel and picked the Ambassador Chicago, since I walk past it almost every day.  It's such a beautiful boutique hotel in the Gold Coast of Chicago with so much history, that I thought it would be great to stay there.  The entire staff, especially Vidal Moran, the Director in the front office, were so wonderful.  They even had a special welcome bag for my little doggy Juliette including treats and a foldable bowl.  So adorable! The guest room I stayed in with a King bed (that was so comfortable) was huge!  If you haven't seen the hotel take a walk through it.  It's fabulous! I loved it and I highly recommend this to anyone traveling or just wants to stop in for a drink or dinner!"
256,I was there for my anniversary with my husband and miss Kay 🤑 she was very patient and hospitable she even showed us how to catch the bus and the train how to download Uber  app on her phone but while waiting in line she had a very very nasty guest in front of her and what got me the most was she continue to smile and be professional and polite to the guest even though they were jerks Miss Kay is the greatest of all time.   Mr&Mrs Happy Guest
257,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel (which we’ve stayed at before and love!) in December. She’s a college student in Chicago so we left a bag with the hotel and spent her break in Colorado with the rest of our family. When she came back on her own to pick up the bag (the rest of us live overseas so we were gone by then), she forgot her bag ticket. But Wayne and Kay were incredibly helpful and gracious, and remembered my daughter! They stored her bag for the entire time and made sure nothing happened to it even though she was a few days late on picking it up.  Great hotel with great staff."
258,This hotel is amazing to spend time in Chicago. The one bedroom suite is very spacious and beautiful like photos. Especially Kay and Wayne were so helpful and made my day :) Me and my family truly had amazing time here and will definitely come back :)
259,"A few weeks ago, my (now) fiance and I returned to stay at the hotel where we first met--and he proposed! I was immediately struck by the kindness and high level of customer service provided by everyone, from the hilarious bellhop and attentive bartender, to the welcoming front desk staff and managers. The hotel is so elegant and unique--it's completely modern yet has so many restored vintage touches. Even the toiletries are luxurious! We loved our room--the views were stunning and the bed and couches were super comfortable. The bar is also fantastic, and there are a few really cool lounge areas near the lobby where you can hang out.   The staff went WAY BEYOND ""above and beyond"" to put together a romantic and wonderful night's stay for us. Their employees bent over backwards to"
260,Found hotel through TripAdvisor. Great location . Walking distance to many restaurants and Lake Michigan .  Room was very nice . Receptionist Natalie was extremely  pleasant and helpful . Good experience. Will stay again
261,"Kay was fantastic! Kay is an employee at Gold Coast (Chicago) Ambassador and she made the experience at her property an outstanding one. I recommend this brand of hotel and this particular property for those traveling to Chicago (downtown) whether locally or internationally. The property is very clean, the staff is very professional (Kay), and the bar area, including fireplace, really sets the tone and ambiance for a cozy and memorable stay. Kay made it a great stay! I hope she continues to receive opportunities to grow within the Ambassador brand, and even if she decides to change companies... I know she will be an outstanding asset and leader. Thank you, Ambassador Chicago. Thank you, Kay!"
262,My husband and I came to this hotel on a weekend trip for a wedding.  Check in was easy and the concierge had a lot of information/fun facts about Chicago which made out short stay fun. He recommended pizza which was spot on! (Thank you for that)  The room was clean and cozy. My husband and i particularly liked the toiletry. I know that’s something many people don’t really comment on that but the quality of it was worth mentioning.
263,"I surprised my wife with an impromptu Chicago getaway for our 15th wedding anniversary. Our stay at the Ambassador Chicago was beyond my expectations. The class, the service, the amenities were on point. A special thanks to Kay at the front desk. Her knowledge and expertise provided that extra plus that made this getaway unforgettable."
264,My family and I recently stayed at The Ambassador Chicago on a Thanksgiving family holiday trip....... from the front door welcoming staff to the attentive and prompt housekeeping personnel ... we were treated so graciously... lovely staff all the way around I would highly recommend this hotel and have stayed here many times and received consistent superb customer service... and our family dog also loved the stay!😘😍😘😘😍😘
265,"The Ambassador Hotel is a tucked-away gem. It is perfect. The staff is profecient, cordial, professional and kind. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The pillows are incredible (hint to management: buy more than you need and offer to sell them to guests). It is now my go-to hotel in Chicago."
266,"Myself and my husband essentially lived in The Ambassador in the lead up to our destination Chicago wedding -- therefore I believe our lengthy stay warrants a very much deserved review. The aesthetic of the hotel is breathtaking, the ambience in each public space feels fitting, the guest rooms are modern, comfortable, clean and calming. Ishmael, Kay, Natalie, among all others on staff, are spectacular -- they went above and beyond helping us and most of our wedding guests with endless luggage, questions, issues. The hotel manager kindly sent us a bottle of bubbly and strawberries upon our arrival, and when our guests began to arrive, Ishamel and the others had more bubbly and goodies sent to our room. We have and will happily return."
267,"The ambassador hotel is a beautiful and elegant hotel in Chicago. We were wowed by the service. Ms. Kay checked us in, it was seamless and professional. We let her know we just got married and she was so excited for us. In her power she was able to send us a charcuterie plate with a congratulations card, wishing us a beautiful marriage. Overall would recommend 10/10 thank you Kay, Ishmael the doorman and Jose the Secuirty man, for your help throughout our stay!"
268,"Just stayed a couple of weeks ago on October 4th-9th and I loved it. Kay at check in was awesome, she was very helpful and friendly. Mrs. Teresa Quito who cleaned my room every day was more than outstanding, she is been working there for 14 years and she talk about her job like if it was her first day. Another employee who is proud to work there is Kenny at front desk, I Chek out and he assisted me at 4 am and told me the History of the hotel. Next time I visit Chicago I will definetily stay at this great Hotel. Thanks for made me feel at home!!!  Me gusta  Compartir"
269,"My husband and I decided to visit for a  weekend getaway and chose the Ambassador. It was a great decision. We loved the location, convenient to restaurants and shopping in the Gold Coast. It's also right near the North end of Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile.   The staff were exceptionally warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. Everyone we met from the Bell Staff and Front Desk, to the bar and Housekeeping, they were all kind and hospitable.  The room was nice and the hotel has the charm of years past combined with modern amenities. We especially enjoyed the Keurig in the room and the bathroom toiletries.   We had drinks at the bar and grab and go breakfast in the Library, both were great. The drinks were delicious and the grab and go breakfast was ideal for a quick, tasty bite."
270,"I LOVE the Ambassador. It's my home away from home. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. I love the ambiance of the hotel, they have an amazing entrance lobby, library room and bar on the first floor.   The staff is exceptional- Kay always makes me feel welcome with her big smile and warm personality. Everyone is very attentive with their service. I cannot say enough good things about the staff.   I stay in Chicago often and would only stay here. I highly recommend this as your go to for a business or vacation travel."
271,"My experience is a unique one. Not everyone’s Dad worked at the Ambassador in the 60’s. I grew up hearing the Sinatra, Kennedys, Garland, and even Lassie stories of staying at the Ambassador. I felt like I knew every inch of the property, but yet as an adult, had never stayed there. Decades (I mean, decades) later, I stayed there for the first time. I couldn’t help my emotions and told Kay at the front desk my story. She seemed as excited as I was, and I felt so welcomed by her reaction, almost as if I was coming home. My husband and I settled into our room when room service knocked on the door. I told my husband that they probably made a mistake so I would let them know. The young man said that “This was for Ingrid”, and I said that there must be a mistake and he insisted that"
272,Hotel interior is gorgeous! You guys did an amazing job with the renovations- Restaurant happy hour is perfect! And Kay at the front desk welcomes me with a smile and makes me laugh after a long day of traveling every time! She is fantastic.   
273,"I've been to Chicago over a dozen times and rarely decide to stay in a luxury hotel, but two weeks ago I decided to try something new. I am glad I did! The room was spectacular and so comfortable yet luxurious, and I really felt like I made the right decision. Aside from the amenities, I also really appreciated the kind staff. While everyone was wonderful, I particularly enjoyed a bellman who helped me out named Ismaeel! This young man so warm, friendly and funny I instantly felt like I already knew him. On top of that, he did an excellent job with my bags. Just a great example of the quality staff at The Ambassador!"
274,"The Ambassador is a lovely, charming hotel with hints of glamour the moment you walk into the front doors. It's located on the Gold Coast and is tucked away on a residential street in a neighborhood that's excellent for walking.   The hotel lobby, library, and bar are lovely. There was a fire in the library when we arrived, which was quite welcoming. Our rooms (we had a celebrity suite + attached room, as well as another room down the hall) were clean, airy, bright, and well-appointed. We loved the toiletries. The beds were super comfortable, the rooms spacious. The views were terrific - all city!   The Ambassador is in a great location for a lot of walking - you can easily walk to a variety of shops, bars, restaurants, and the Magnificent Mile.   Finally, the staff was"
275,"This was my first stay and from the moment my cab arrived the staff were delightful. Every single individual I interacted with was friendly, courteous and paused to interact with me. It has been a long time since I’ve experienced such warm service.  The room was clean and functional. Secure elevator service. Bath tub. Efficient room service that exceeded my expectations.  I will stay again for sure."
276,Kay checked us in quickly and was friendly and very helpful.  Kay was very upbeat and helpful.   The location can not be best. The Gold Coast has it all. Shopping and food. Quick walk or Uber to Michigan Avenue.
277,"Let’s start with the positive aspects: Location - Gold Coast far enough away from loud city street noise in a residential area Historic building with great architecture  Friendly housekeeping and bellman staff Clean room with comfortable bed & temperature control though small  Well stocked mini bar   Negative aspects: Paper thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room at all hours  Spotty front desk staff in terms of friendliness and competence- examples: Upon checking in we were told the driver room was not ready. We were asked to leave my cell phone so that the front desk a call when the room was ready. They never called. First morning, after calling at 6 AM when our next room neighbors were in ordinately loud, I was told that they could call to ask them to turn down"
278,"It was quiet and in a wonderful neighborhood, the Gold Coast but we could walk to downtown. Our room was lovely and spacious. Hotel staff was very helpful in all respects. It wasn't too expensive. All told, a great place to stay when in Chicago. Only drawback was the lack of a restaurant but we heard they are going to restore the restaurant in the future."
279,"I stayed at the Ambassador last month for a long weekend while in Chicago for a wedding.  The hotel is on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood, and a short walk away from restaurants and entertainment. Our room was spacious, clean and made when we arrived. We were greeted our first evening by Kay at the front desk. She stuck out as a highlight of our trip- welcome us back every time we saw her, giving great local tips and cracking jokes. Thank you, Kay for making our weekend! We will be back!"
280,"I traveled to Chicago to attend a friend's bday party. This was the closest major hotel to the venue. Decent room with a king bed, large closet. The bed was interestingly lower to the ground. The fitness room in the lower lobby is small, only has 2 treadmills, one elliptical, two weight machines and dumbbells. The neighborhood is residential, so don't expect to walk out into city life with stores, restaurants, etc... "
281,"I usually don't write reviews,I travel a lot, meet a lot of people. After hotel after hotel, services and fake smiles are the same, util I stayed at Ambassador Chicago! The level of service that I received from Kay was beyond exceptional. Kay really made my stay pleasant, she has given me a new hope with staying at different hotels. I will now, expect anything less. This was the BEST experience I have ever had while traveling for work. Not only was Kay attentive to all of her guest needs, she made me feel as if I was her only guest in the 200 + room hotel. Ambassador Chicago is my new home, when traveling to Chicago. My room was nice, nice decor. However; it was the service I received from Ms. Kay, that made my stay worth the travel. I didn't even mind the colder weather in"
282,"This hotel, in the near North Side, is within easy walking distance of the miracle mile. They do have on-site parking available, but it’s expensive as it is everywhere in Chicago. We’ve now stayed there three times and each time the experience was wonderful.  The staff has always been very friendly and courteous, housekeeping has been exceptional. The rooms are very well appointed and spotless from a housekeeping standpoint.  We have not eaten there but for their standard breakfast sandwich and coffee fare. What is unusual is the reasonable price of the breakfast sandwich. It was very good too. In downtown Chicago you almost expect to pay more than average.  In addition, they have a nice bar wHich  is quite popular. Again, this was a family visit so we didn’t partake.  For"
283,"I loved this hotel. Quiet area and rooms, the room itself is quaint. The selection of in room amenities is very impressive. Is also appreciate their commitment to eco friendly processes. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone."
284,"The rooms are clean and have lots of space, the hotel has a charming fireplace, good options to buy breakfast inside the hotel and a very nice bar. The staff was extremely nice. Location is good for dining but a bit far from downtown."
285,"My boyfriend and I were greeted by Ms.K front desk receptionist. She was extremely friendly and very  in tune to my mood and needs. After one delay after another while traveling to the hotel, I was exhausted. Finding out that our room was not ready only made matters worse. I expressed my frustration but Ms.K remained calm and sympathized with me and upgraded our room.which was magnificent. Just talking to that young lady put me ino  a better mood. I wish more people who deal with the public could posses her attitude and willingness to help others"
286,"Nothing per se wrong with the establishment, but I wouldn't say it truly excels in any area either. Room was clean, but quite boring and lifeless. Hangers in the bathroom weren't tightly screwed and they were dangling from the wall as if the lightest load will be too much for them. Shower head was funny and hard to operate. Breakfast was quite terrible (if you are staying there, go to the 3rd Coast which is just 100m away). Staff is indeed helpful. Nevertheless, an average hotel with an average experience."
287,"My husband and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary and we decided to stay here overnight as a mini getaway. This was the best choice we could have made. Our first encounter was with the front desk staff member named Kay who presented us with stellar services from the moment we arrived. She was friendly, helpful and over accommodating. She made immediately feel welcomed. The hotel decor is beautiful, the staff was excellent, the food is delish and the rooms are next Level clean, even the housekeeping staff was excellent. We loved the view and we will definitely be returning for another stay in the future. As a lifelong Chicagoan, this is definitely a gem."
288,"Easy and enjoyable walk to Michigan Avenue, excellent staff, delicious food.  Lots of lovely homes, restaurants, shopping in this district.  There is a view of Lake Michigan from street in front of the hotel entrance."
289,"hotel was crowded (peak time July I suppose). the service was excellent, from the front counter staff being so helpful and friendly to the cleaning staff. Location is awesome- just 2 blocks from the beach."
290,"A colleague booked rooms here thru a third-party (hotwire I think). Other than the usurious $67 valet-only parking fee (NYC is less expensive), everything about the hotel was a pleasant surprise. The lobby is intensely attractive, as is the library, which has a fireplace (real, I think) and overpriced-but-drinkable coffee in the a.m. The restaurant is undergoing a big makeover, so we only had the room service menu in the bar area, but I have to say, the food was top drawer. The rooms are an intriguing mix of modern--lighting, super-low beds, gorgeous bathroom--with old-schools touches. There were some oddities (the closet, sans door, was the size of a small apartment), but I find this character appealing. The wifi worked. I was too lazy for the gym, but there is one. All in all,"
291,Wayne Wayne Wayne!! This man deserves a trophy for best customer service!! Our stay at the ambassador was amazing thanks to the great service and polite staff. Rooms were excellent and very clean. We will definitely be staying here on our future visits to the windy city.
292,Rooms were very clean! Like the overall atmosphere of the hotel. Rooms are pretty modern. Great location for a reasonable price. Thank you to Teresa Quito and the rest of the housekeeping team for a great job!
293,"All main attractions are in walking distance or easy metro access. Rooms are nice and big, beds are comfortable, breakfast offer is sufficient. Staff is friendly and helpful. Pet friendly hotel next to the lake."
294,"The Ambassador Hotel is located in a truly beautiful neighborhood (Gold Coast), yet it’s only minutes from the hustle-bustle of downtown. It’s also very easily walkable from the Ambassador to Lake Michigan (jogging trail along the lake, sunbathing, etc.). The hotel itself is very clean and the service is excellent. The first time we were there we got bumped up to the Penthouse. It was exquisite and the whole place holds a lot of history. This is our go-to place whenever we are in town. "
295,"Location is great, walking distance to the lake and to many other places rooms and bathrooms are very good But what really matters is the great staff they have, all of them really helpful, specially Kay, she was the best!! I need extra help and she was on top of it and did a wonderful job, she is one of a kind They should work on the breakfast, which is terrible, very simple things can improve it totally, again the staff helps to go through a bad breakfast will be back"
296,Nice clean room . We would have liked coffee/tea making facilities in the room . The was very little information about Chicago which  we had to get elsewhere. Other than checking in and out we had no contact with any staff. We didn't use the bar or restaurants
297,"Great location, super friendly helpful staff, clean room, toiletries provided were really nice.  Only disappointments parking is a challenge and no pool/spa.  Do recommend and definitely would stay again."
298,"I am a bit late in writing this review but better late than never.  I stayed here on business from August 11th, 2019 to August 15th, 2019.  The hotel is simply fantastic.  The rooms are absolutely spacious and comfortable.  The location was perfect for my needs.  Safe area to go out and walk in.  Many eateries/restaurants near by that you can walk to.  Everyone at the front desk was friendly.  I may forget some names but Danella, Kenya, and Batista, were all wonderful.  But if I had to choose one favorite thing about this entire trip then I would have to say it was definitely Natalie at the front desk.  This girl is absolutely amazing and extremely aesthetically pleasing to my eyes.....yes, that is a compliment to you Natalie.  She is simply, the most beautiful girl I've ever"
299,"Ambassador East is a charming, soothingly comfortable hotel in beautiful, Gold Coast Chicago. The staff are stellar, and totally responsive, going Beyond the call of duty,to every need and request. My wonderful stay is truly, 'Home Away From Home'."
300,"Stayed here for two nights which was great lovely hotel as far as the room was concerned, food another thing, quite rubbish and expensive and served in very dark lounge or restaurant. The hotel has bags of history as it was, we understand, frequently used in the 40s 50s and 60s by many of the entertainment stars who were travelling from New York to Los Angeles somebody took the trouble of obtaining photographs of theses artists which must have numbered in 100s all very interesting as we understood that the photographs were origionaly displayed in a bar but now, unfortunately, they are mostly displayed in a basement area by the toilets. It is a shame nobody ever thought of adding names to the photographs it was fine for the well know artists but for the lesser known ones they"
301,"I wanted to make last minute plans for my wife's birthday weekend.  Natalie at the front desk and Ishmael at the front door came to my rescue.  They went above and beyond to make our night a memorial one at the Ambassador Chicago.  Natalie came up with the great idea and Ishmael hustled to the store to get the necessities and returned in timely fashion.  Upon my departure, they personally made an effort to wish me well and to make sure if we were pleased with our stay.  The Ambassador Chicago is now on top of my list when looking for a weekend getaway.  I consider it to be my hotel and will definitely recommend it to all of my associates."
302,"The Ambassador Chicago Hotel was probably sleek whenever it opened, but the hotel is extremely tired with a low standard of services.  1) Scratched furniture. 2) Stained furniture -- doesn't help that all the furniture is covered in white slip-over covers. 3) Almost electrical outlets where you would want them, though a small outlet docking station or whatever you call it was at the desk. But nothing by the bed or nightstand. 4) Japanese-style beds that are super low to the floor. 5) Walls that desperately need a fresh paint coat. In some places they have done patch jobs but not painted the full wall. 6) Bathroom tile flooring that needs new grouting. 7) Old door knobs and fixtures that are dilapidated. I'm sure someone thinks these are nice ""historic"" fixtures but they look"
303,"We stayed at the Ambassador while attending a wedding in Chicago.  The location is fantastic,  near all sorts of restaurants and among the most beautiful houses in the city.  We did not have a car, but all our travel was easily accomplished via shirt Lyft or Uber rides.  There is also much to see and do within walking distance.   The room was clean and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable.  We slept well.   This is an old and storied hotel that is well maintained and staffed by well trained professionals.   We felt that the Ambassador delivered good value for our money.  "
304,"This establishment needs to seriously get it together. We booked two rooms. My group came at different check in times. First party checked in at 3:00 and they did not have the room ready until 4:00! Second party checked in at 4:00 and they did not have it ready until 4:30. Check in time is 3:00! For a boutique hotel that has been around for awhile, you need to step your game up significantly considering there are so many other hotels in Chicago. And to be quite frank, I've actually always gotten lucky and been able to check in and get a room BEFORE check in time at majority of hotels I travel to. Also the beds were listed as King beds which we selected and they appear to be queen beds instead. Very disappointed and do not recommend."
305,"Had only one night in Second City for business. Found this gem which I remembered from my early days in Chicago, when there was an Ambassador East and West across the street from each other. Pleasantly surprised by the modern upgrades - comfortable room, nice lobby, friendly staff, reasonable price. The location can’t be beat. Away from the noise, but within a short walk to lakeshore, Michigan Ave, subway, and old town.   My only issue was no coffee in the room. Had to go to the lobby in the morning to buy it from the barista. "
306,"The legendary but tired Ambassador East got the Ian Schrager treatment in 2010 and was rebranded the Public.  It followed the classic Schrager formula of renovating old dowager hotels, creating dazzling public spaces and turning small outdated sleeping rooms into funky-but-chic, design-forward places to lay one's head after the party.  Even the epochal Pump Room, Frank Sinatra's go-to gin mill when he visited Chicago, got Schragerized.   Apparently the new concept was only modestly successful, because Schrager sold out in 2016.  New owners restored the Ambassador name, but maintained the Schrager boutique hotel vibe.  And they shuttered the Pump Room, rebranding it ""Booth One"" (in reference to ... the Pump Room?!), which has subsequently closed.  Are you still with me?  The"
307,"I was here visiting a family member and came to the desk to ask the Agent to call for them and Kay went out of her way to help me. As I waited for my Auntie, Kay (Kenya)bring me a cup of coffee and I believe she may have pay for it of if her own pocket. Just thought it was great to meet and have nice people still around we never tell the good story’s always the bad just want to let the company know that Kay (Kenya) is Awesome and she really care about the Guests"
308,"I stayed at the Ambassador Chicago for 6 nights in March 2019 and, overall, I was quite impressed with this hotel especially considering what I paid for my room The hotel is a good 4 star standard with very nice public areas and fairly recently refurbished bedrooms. The owners have tried to retain as much of the old style charm as they possibly could while still  providing the amenities of a modern hotel My room was very big and quite comfortable. As other reviewers have stated some of the furniture in the room is a bit ""IKEAeske"" , not that there is anything wrong with IKEA furniture I had 2 minor issues with the hotel; - The room is a bit like a shop so there is just so much stuff such as hats etc. left out in the bedroom for you to buy, the management could probably do with"
309,Great hotel. Very nostalgic! Great service. Friendly staff!! It was my birthday and they delivered champagne and chocolate to my room! I would stay there again and also recommend to anyone going to Chicago.
310,My stay at the ambassador Chicago it is a historical hotel located in the best ever part of Chicago which is the Gold Coast the staff is  fabulous .... Thank you Maria. Maldonado Supervisor.   I made reservation for my next visit thank you 😊 namaste
311,I have stayed at the Ambassador many times when it was The Public and always loved the cool chic modern vibe of this historic hotel. So I was curious to see if things have changed. I had a one night stay at the Ambassador in mid July and I was greeted by Maria at the front desk. She was extremely knowledgeable about the hotel and even told me a great story about a Taylor that used to stay there;) Needless to say Maria went above and beyond to exceed my expectations accommodating my requests and arranging a fantastic room with a great view. Overall I think the hotel is even better now that it is Ambassador again. I look forward to my next trip back to Chicago and plan to stay at the Ambassador again. 
312,"This hotel is in a gorgeous location. It's surrounded by beautiful and stately Chicago style ""brownstones"" and homes. It's location is extremely walkable to many major city attractions (Mag Mile, Hancock Building, etc) and the Redline train is just a 5 minute walk. The beach path and LSD are literally down the street. From the beach path it's a super easy walk or bike ride to Lincoln Park.   The hotel bar was very relaxing and full of history. I stuck to wine but their cocktails looked super yummy.  The only issue I had with this hotel was that my room didn't have a closet. I found it super odd because I never not had a closet in my hotel room before. I didn't have anything to hang, but my travel companion did. She had to drap her dress on an arm chair. They should at least have"
313,"Lovely boutique hotel in a magnificent neighborhood, the Gold Coast. Rooms were partially modernized, a bit on the small size, but comfortable with a very comfortable bed, which was a bit low. Large walk in closet and modernized bathroom. The service is pretty good, the ambience in the lobby and lounge was quite chic. Great location for walking in north Chicago, Lincoln park, and quick ride to other areas."
314,"A beautiful hotel in a great area.  The hotel is a couple of blocks from the magnificent mile in the most beautiful neighborhood. It is wonderful that you can walk a couple of blocks and be out of the hectic area of the city. There are still so many restaurants within a block of the hotel. The hotel has such a great bar. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was huge and very comfortable. There is no microwave but you can request one. There is a bar refrigerator which we emptied and used to store our own snacks. And this is the crazy part and downside of the room - there are two large walk in closets in the room which are lovely, right next to the tiniest bathroom. Why couldn’t, there be just one closet, you are only there on holiday and make the bathroom bigger. The space"
315,The hotel is descent located in a nice neighborhood with plenty of food choices within walking distance. The rooms are kind of small but the bathroom is what kind led me to the review. Not only is it very small it has a toilet you would find at a truck stop. One you have to flush with your foot. Total turn off since I didn’t want to use my house shoe each time to flush. The staff was very nice the rooms could use a little updating not a bad stay the beds where on a platform that sat low to the floor didn’t sleep that well. I probably wouldn’t stay again especially because of the bathroom and the platform beds 
316,"The Ambassador has been the best hotels I’ve stayed in by far, the staff is super helpful, very educated on the night life and best restaurants around. The bell hop Ishmaeel was outstanding. Will return soon."
317,"The location was great.  It’s close to the lake and close to great restaurants and shopping.  On the downside, the valet was $67/day or you can self park half a block away for $45.  The hotel looks great for an old building.  We booked 2 rooms and they gave us adjoining rooms which worked out pretty well for us.  The bathrooms were small but decent and the rooms were a good size.  The beds were comfy.  In our room, the side table lamp keeps going on & off late at night without anyone turning it on.  I say ghosts but hubby thinks it’s an electrical short.  Either way would be scary lol 🤷🏻‍♀️"
318,We just stayed at the Ambassador and had a great experience with this hotel. We were traveling with our 2 young kids and had a 1 bedroom suite. This was a great choice and affordable for anyone traveling with kids because the bedroom had a separate door from the living room and a huge walk in closet. This is an awesome location to the water and restaurants and access to the train. Thanks for a really nice time and we will for sure be back.
319,Overrated. Outdated. Poor WiFi connection. Air conditioning barely worked. Only a duvet on bed. No separate sheet. Website said you get breakfast if you book directly with them but had to argue to get them to honour that - which they barely did. The breakfast itself wasn't worth it - sandwiches or limited continental. No complimentary water. Safe was small and placed about 6 feet up on a shelf. Nowhere to put suitcases. Only positive thing was cleanliness.   This place relies on its reputation and looking pretty but doesn't deliver of 4*.   Would not recommend
320,"The Conrad is always my first choice when I'm in Chicago and they've never let me down in my 15+ stays.  Rooms are beautiful and well appointed, but the service is what matters most and whether it's one of the restaurants (which are both great), front desk or valet, it's always A+.  They also have one of the best gyms I've ever seen in a hotel."
321,"Beautiful room was nicely appointed and had a large TV.  Very quiet.  Bathroom was lovely with double sinks.  The bed was very comfortable.  Enough closet space.  Refrigerator is in a ""drawer"" which is neat, but it didn't keep anything very cold.  Staff was friendly.  Problem checking in with credit card machine which didn't work.  Have eaten at the restaurant before (not this visit) and it's ""ok"" but overpriced for what you get.  If you get a good rate here, this is an outstanding hotel choice.  Hotel parking is a rip-off... we parked a block away for half the price."
322,"The staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient for a basic hotel chain. A couple of hours before arrival I received a personal text asking me what my ETA would be, and we engaged in a few more texts with a couple of questions that I had. The valet dudes were great as well, and the front desk staff ppl were some funny folks. I even sang along to the PA that was playing I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher, to their amusement but to my buddy's chagrin."
323,"Before you stay with ANY Hilton brand hotel, you might want to read about my experience and make your own decision.  I'll cut straight to chase;  * Checked into the Conrad Hilton in Dec '19 for a few nights.   * I was given keys to someone else room. I walked in, they were in the shower, underwear and personal items on the bed. If it were someone else other than me, they could have stolen the persons valuables and/or attacked the person in the shower.  * I returned the keys to reception, reported that and was given new keys.  * When I got to MY room, the safe wasn't working, I reported it and was told it would be fixed. With that in mind, I went out for dinner and drinks. Next morning my passport and a significant amount of cash is missing.  * I complained to the hotel manager,"
324,"Wonderful location, beautiful hotel, professional staff, luxurious rooms, bathroom & bedding. The in-room coffee is a nespresso machine with a wonderful array of options a accoutrements. So nice to wake up to excellent coffee in the room. Can’t wait to visit again!"
325,"This hotel was amazing, right on the magnificent mile.  Within walking distance of all the great shops and restaurants.  This place has great views, great staff, wonderful amenties.  Room service was great and they had anything available you may have forgotten.  They also offer free water your whole stay.  "
326,Perfect Location. Luxury to the nines. Rooms are very spacious and clean.  Staff is very friendly. Greeted at the door every time I go in and out of the hotel.  Continental breakfast with hot eggs and bacon was great for the one day they did it.  (Hope they continue with it) David S. In the restaurant went above and beyond with his hospitality.  Thank you for great stay Conrad Staff.  Highly recommend. 
327,"Loved the Conrad, it was right in downtown Chicago. The staff was incredibly helpful and nice. The room was very big and had plenty of space. It also had a nespresso machine with everything you would need to make coffee in the morning. The fridge was also stocked with bottles water. If you needed anything, you could send a text and it would be delivered. The views from the room and the lobby are amazing! We loved our stay here. "
328,"I booked the hotel through Travelzoo and was nicely surprised at the great location and value. The hotel was beautiful and clean and surrounded by many attractions such as shopping, restaurants and to our surprise Starbucks Reserve. "
329,I stayed at the Conrad on a snowy trip to Chicago recently. The room was amazing. Tons of unique things that differentiate the Conrad brand from other Hilton properties. Housekeeping is phenomenal and goes the extra mile. The lobby isn’t in the main floor so it is nice that you can simply get in the elevator and head to your room without a lot of fuss. The food at the restaurant was also delicious at dinner time. One of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Breakfast was not nearly as good. One item to note is that the room was incredibly quiet for a downtown hotel. Almost silent. I will be back. 
330,My husband and I stayed here for just a couples weekend filled with shopping and dining...this hotel is extremely nice and is in a phenomenal location right off the Magnificent Mile. You won’t be disappointed if you stay here!
331,I had an very pleasant time at the Conrad. The hotel has an amazing location right downtown on River North. The staff is excellent and very helpful. On the third night I wanted to switch rooms as I was having a friend join me. They were able to accommodate me. From check in to checkout everything was seemless.
332,"I stay in the Conrad on a Regular basis for work. Love the rooms 😍 The bathroom is the highlight of the room the shower is amazing 😍 great amenity Kits in the room also. Electric blinds both blackout and sheer which is pretty cool.  The have a lovely restaurant on the 20th floor and a rooftop bar. Both are lovely to chill in and great views, but quiet expensive. Great for a night cap if you wore out in Chicago before hand.  The location is amazing also.   Enjoy your stay."
333,"1st time here! Loved it, great view of Mich ave. Right behind the new Starbucks Reserve & close to everything. Room was nice, everyone was courteous & friendly. All the hotels in the area are pricey so we felt this was great for the price!"
334,"This is our go to! We have stayed at many different places in downtown and we love this place! Clean, trendy, and staff is amazing. We got an upgrade this time and it was spectacular. Great corner view room."
335,The whole experience was great the people at the front door were amazing and they always opened the door for me the valet always got my car immediately I never had to wait free water at the hotel and the fitness center was great
336,"The hotel is located on a quiet street but is very close to the local attractions, stores and restaurants.  The service from entering the hotel through room service time is excellent. Very clean rooms as well. The gym has everything you would find in a traditional gym and more than a typical hotel."
337,"This is one of my favorite places to stay in the city for short periods of time. The location is great, with plenty to walk to in the evenings after work. The rooms are spacious and very well cared for. The staff is respectful and attentive; and the whiskey selection at the bar is one of the best in the city. I come frequently and enjoy my stay every time. "
338,"We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights.  It was an exceptional room and the service from the door staff and check-in staff was superb.  The valet parking lot is a couple of blocks away, so it takes 10-15min to retrieve a car minimum.  If someone is ahead of you it can be 20-30, so just plan ahead when you call for your car.  Breakfast items are overpriced, but I guess that is Chicago.  If you don't need to eat multiple plates of food, I would go to the Starbucks Roastery on the corner instead."
339,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel! Love the interior and plush beds, bathrobes and slippers. The shades opened and closed with the push of a button on either side of the bed, and the view was lovely from the 18th floor. I enjoyed coffee from the in-room Nespresso machine while getting ready in the morning. Cannot say enough good things about the Conrad Chicago. "
340,NEVER going to stay in any Conrad franchise ever again. Called the hotel regarding some urgent issue and have to modify the reservation. The operator could not solve my issue but the manager was not willing to have the flexibility to help.
341,"Right in the heart of Chicago.  The staff was excellent at check in and whatever we needed.   Sunday morning Brunch was a little understaffed, but still enjoyable.   I would plan on staying at the Conrad sometime soon."
342,"Great stay at this well located Chicago hotel.  Service was excellent and the staff were all very courteous . The rooms were clean and quiet (which made for a good night of sleep).  Overall, a well maintained facility."
343,"We stayed here for a last minute one night trip to Chicago in January, 2020.  We got a Travelzoo deal that included parking and breakfast, so it was very reasonably priced.  The rooms were a bit on the small side, but very comfortable.  The rooms were recently updated and modern.  The location is perfect if you want to enjoy Michigan Ave, however we soon realized that Michigan Ave is suffering from the death of retail like most malls.  There just is not much to do.  The Starbucks Reserve Roastery is very close to this hotel, but we weren't that impressed with it.  One downside of this hotel is the street noise.  I've stayed in downtown hotels before and never had street noise this bad.  Multiple times during the night we woke up to sirens, revving engines, and squealing tires. "
344,This is my second stay at the Conrad and I loved it just as much as the first. The rooms are beautiful and sleek with tons of space and controls all over the place for various lighting options. the closets are huge and so are the bathrooms. Truly feels like minimalist luxury. And can't beat the location. I also got texts from the hotel staff checking in and asking if I needed anything.
345,The staff exceeded our expectations and was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had.  They made our daughter feel like she was royalty and made us feel very welcome and accommodating.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
346,"I booked this with a Travelzoo ""Top 20"" deal for a short weekend trip to Chicago.  With free valet parking and breakfast, the hotel was a steal.  The hotel itself was well worth the price without the ""freebies"".  The location was fantastic.  The King room with Mag Mile view was spacious, clean, modern and comfortable.  Bathroom had double sinks and great stall shower.  Great technology to control lighting and drapes. Loved it!!"
347,"The room was lovely and most of the amenities were great. The exception was the pillows; Hilton properties continue to provide pillows that go flat within a few seconds of lying on them. The service was uneven: Check-in was good. On Day 2, our room was not cleaned when we returned after being out all day; we had to sit in the lobby for 45 minutes that evening while the room was made up. The person at ""customer service"" had the audacity to suggest that they just give clean towels instead. And we weren't even offered a bottled water in the lobby for our troubles. In the restaurant for the included continental breakfast, on the first day the service was almost non-existent. There was no one available at the host's stand for nearly 10 minutes. When we were finally seated, no servers"
348,"The location of the hotel is wonderful, and right next to one of the largest Starbucks.  It is easily accessible to many Chicago features.  The hotel staff was very accommodating.  Sedalia was a great help with our luggage and making us get settled in."
349,"I like to stay at Conrad properties whenever I can so was looking forward to the Chicago Conrad. The location is great! You’re a few steps from Michigan Ave and it’s easy to walk to the Gold Coast area or Lincoln Park, not to mention, downtown, Millenium Park etc.   The lobby is on an upper floor (20th), but guest rooms start on lower floors (8th floor, I think). I thought this was a huge inconvenience since it’s not practical to go to the lobby floor when your room is on a lower floor. I’ve been to other Conrad hotels where the lobby is not on the ground floor, but in those instances, rooms are all located above the lobby so it’s easy to stop in at the concierge or at the front desk if you need something on your way down and you're headed out for the day, or on your way up to"
350,"The property itself is decently maintained and well situated. The room was fairly large and comfortable, however several improvements could be made.   1) the breakfast for diamond members is horrendous - think worse than a roadside motel 6. It’s basically a bred item or two and yogurt. It’s a way for the property to steer people into ordering from their pricey ala carte menu.   2) room wasn’t cleaned well. We had our dnd sign on in the morning, but no one came around to clean in the afternoon. No turndown service.   3) they couldn’t figure out how to make the electronic key on the Hilton app worked, despite several trips to the from desk.   4) still trying to figure out how to get the Hilton points for my paid stay from the property.  It’s unlikely that I’d stay at this property"
351,"Firstly, this is a Conrad which only opened a few years ago - like most Conrad hotels, it is stylish, refined and has generally great service.  However, while I wanted to love this hotel, unfortunately a few small things impacted my opinion - namely,  1) the decor in the room seemed too minimalist to the point of being unfinished; I aesthetic is a bit early 90s and not to my liking.  It was also quite loud on the 9th floor with noise coming from neighboring room and another floor 2) Diamond status was not acknowledged and no upgrade offered; I do not have an issue of not being offered an upgrade (as the regular room was large and I understand there are limited amount of suites, although a higher floor would have been appreciated) but would be much better if they were proactive"
352,"For being my first time at this property, the staff provided an OUTSTANDING experience / stay. Complete attention to detail & making my stay Fantastic by adding a personal touch to their services & displaying professionalism."
353,"The check in was bad. That creates a rough start. They stated that they had given my suite away, later after complaining they found my suite.  The Good: Like other Conrad’s, the Property is beautiful. The rooms, everything you’d expect from a 5 star hotel in appearance. Stylish, upscale, tasteful and spacious.  Front Desk representatives Emma, Yasmin and Christina. Emma almost singlehandedly held up the service commitment that I would expect as a Hilton Diamond member. She cares about her work and that says more than the gentlemen who checked me in.  Yasmin and Christina offered solid advice about the hotels offerings.   The Bad:  Housekeeping was completely unacceptable.  Unwashed coffee cups were put back in the clean service bar. They’d been rinsed but still had coffee/tea"
354,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway, using Travelzoo promotion that included parking and breakfast. We had stayed with same promo last year. Hotel has great location, very comfortable rooms, very nice restaurant bar and good, efficient service. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a weekend in the city. Conrad delivered on all counts-"
355,This boutique Hilton hotel is located steps from Michigan Avenue and the new ultimate Starbucks. We walked to the Chicago Theater and dives at Trattoria 10 on North Dearborn. We also visited the Art Institute for the Andy Warhol exhibit. It was a great weekend experience.
356,"Concierge, Valet & Front Desk are all great! Impression based on lobby is outstanding! First impression upon walking into our room is impressive! However, the room had a section with dead light bulbs, dust on ledges and the black out curtains did close all the way. All of these are small things, but for The Conrad? Details they shouldn't be missing.  Our trip included the breakfast buffet at Baptiste & Bourbon. Cute concept, classy decor, wait staff are helpful & kind. However, their breakfast buffet was absolutely nothing special. It consisted of the same options you would find at a 3-3.5 star hotel; small assortment of bagels & muffins, dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt and fruit. For the price of this ""buffet"", we expected to see more. Waffles, sausage/bacon....something more than"
357,"Very clean hotel and hospitable staff.Good size room , though beds were  smaller then average queen. Over all continental breakfast was good and wholesome. Enjoyed our time.  Location wise,we could not ask for a  better place with the rate we paid."
358,"Proximity to the Starbucks Roastery prompted this choice and I am very happy with the Conrad! The room was lovely, and  the staff were very attentive and welcoming. I would happily stay here again. For some reason they insist on 200 characters, so I will pad it out a little. Haha"
359,"If you can get past the hotel bar hostess who is far too busy and important to be bothered with you and the generally poorly trained or slightly combative staff, you will meet a desk manager who seems to genuinely care and will exercise tact in working through problems.  "
360,"Most of the hotels where I stay for business look the same, so I was surprised by the very modern look and feel of my Conrad Chicago room. A narrow mirror lined most of the room, the cabinets lights turned on when doors were opened, and there was a Nespresso machine. The bathroom had within it a separate room and door for the toilet, which is convenient if more than one person is staying in the room. It was unusual, beautiful, and comfortable."
361,"Though it is a business hotel, our Diamond Member family enjoyed our stay here. They can seem to nickle and dime you for meals but the kids' meals were amazing - scrambled eggs and tons for crispy bacon and french toast was off the hook. GREAT quality food so for $6, whatevs! Rooms were clean and comfy and the location was so prime, we couldn't have asked for better. Definitely would recommend!"
362,"Had a wonderful experience at the Chicago Conrad, The staff exceeded expectations and the location is always a great one for shopping and entertainment. Hats off to Ana at the front desk and the Bell Staff made us feel like royalty."
363,One of my favorite hotels. I love the Conrad and the rooftop. The staff is friendly from the time you walk in until you leave. Very professional and accommodating. I always enjoy myself at The Conrad.
364,We had a wonderful stay at the Conrad. The staff was nice and the room extremely clean which is always appreciated.  The only issue is parking. There’s literally only 3 parking spots to get your car into valet so if those are full you need to double park angering the people behind you or circle the block which takes 15’. My only other suggestion is to increase your late night menu. 
365,"Wonderful stay! Rooms are perfect! Staff is wonderful!!  Ask for Tiesha (T) at breakfast, she is amazing and provided wonderful service!   Tom was our waiter in the evening and he provided wonderful service and very friendly!   The staff who took care of our rooms went an extra step for us and provided us with cables ties to keep our phone, iPad chargers nice and organized!  Things like that and the staff make me always come back!"
366,Expensive restaurant and poor service in the resatuarant. Better options to eat or have a drink around the hotel than inside it. Miss labeled menu did not show what food was in season or not. Lack lack of a microwave in the room was just a let down.
367,"Bad entrance, difficult for uber with luggage, check in floor 20, difficult check in 2 rooms. Rooms are awful, best in area , big modern, large tv . All the amenities . For the price great. Close to Eataly, new starksbuck, theaters AMC , the price for Christmas was very nice "
368,"Here are the pluses for the Conrad Chicago: location, superb valet parking at a reasonable rate for Chicago, capable and welcoming staff, beautiful lobby, bar and p.a. views, spacious and TRULY CLEAN and fresh rooms and linens, spacious bathroom facilities including a wonderful shower AND tub, large flatscreen TV, modern refrigerator, wonderful view of the city from our room...  Now the minuses: well, I can’t think of one.  This is an excellent hotel. One of the great pluses of this hotel is not only the congeniality of the staff, but also it’s location just off the Magnificent Mike.  And the beds are so comfortable, that after a day of shopping, or sightseeing, or visiting with friends, or walking, walking, walking in a city that is pedestrian-friendly, it is a refuge after a"
369,"This is not The Waldorf, but it definitely competes with the other higher tier Chicago hotels. Price is much better than those other higher tier hotels. Rooms are nicely appointed. Soft linens, robes and slippers provided are incredibly comfy. Water, Nespresso machine and hot water kettle are always nice amenities and much appreciated. Bathroom has a beautiful and large double vanity with an enclosed toilet and shower on the opposite end. Overall, nice place and will absolutely stay here again. "
370,"As a Hilton diamond member, anytime I can get a good corporate rate at a Conrad I’m going to grab it. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It’s close to my office and offers me luxury and service that other Hilton brands can’t provide. The room was spacious and full of amenities. I enjoyed the espresso machine. The gym is also very large and full of modern, clean equipment. I will be sure to book early to stay here often. I had a very pleasant stay"
371,Everyone greeted us with a smile and was very helpful. Wonderful view of the city. Our room was available early and they brought up our luggage before we returned. Excellent service without having to ask for it.  
372,"This hotel should be at the top of your list for Chicago. It is *lovely.* From the impeccable friendly service when you walk in to the rooms which are updated, with high ceilings, lovely amenities, lush beds. It is really luxurious - a five star experience. Also the price of the rooms is very reasonable for the quality of the hotel. I stay here whenever I can. I also dined in the restaurant - the service there can vary."
373,Clean nice rooms.  Friendly service.  Near everything!  We had a small issue w our room not being ready and they were beyond accommodating.  Probably third time we have stayed here and won’t be the last.  Parking is a little tough w the new Starbucks next door!!  
374,"We stayed only for one night but it was in a great location, had valet parking, and was easy to check in. The room was large with a great view and a huge bathroom and lots of nice amenities like black out blinds, Nespresso machine, and great products in the bathroom."
375,Great location. Uncomfortable bed. Bathroom could be cleaner. Guest room smelled of cigarettes. Wouldn't recommend unless these things are resolved. Wanted to love this place as it was quite affordable.
376,"Exceptional hotel steps from Michigan Avenue. Well designed luxurious room was spacious, well appointed, spotless and comfortable.  When arriving the doormen were there to greet us and directed us to the elevator to the lobby at the top of the hotel. Check in and all service/ staff were friendly and efficient.  We had room service breakfast which was very good.  This is a fantastic choice for visiting the Magnificent Mile.  We will stay again.  "
377,"Room service was as TERRIBLE as you might expect given the other reviews.  Wish we had heeded them..  My daughter ended up getting sick after eating the food.  We had our grandchildren with us and had to wait more than an hour and a half to get food -- and then the order wasn't even close to what we asked for.    Decided to get up and see if it would be better to go to breakfast in the morning.  After we were finally shown our table, we waited more than fifteen minutes and still no one came to see if we would like coffee or to take an order.  And we were the only ones in the whole place.    The concierge wasn't much better.  Lackluster and disinterested.    Very disappointing."
378,"Right in the middle of the North Michigan shopping area this hotel is very luxurious, a reasonable value for the dollar given the amenities and staffed by great employees. Our suite had an amazing view. We stay every year in December since its' opening. We will be back."
379,The Conrad is a wonderful hotel. The room and bathroom are very clean and nice quality. The food and bar is great too. Great location right on magnificent mile and right next to the new starbucks. Overall great experience. 
380,"I've stayed here a few times for business travel. I always arrive late. The entrance on the ground floor always seems disconnected to the front desk. The bellman asks my name and, then, when I get to the front desk, they seem shocked that I've arrived. Weird. The crazy plants and wild art behind the front desk, oddly disguise the front desk workers who seem to blend in. Then, their personality is a bit off-putting - they seem annoyed. One night, I asked for help with two small things and they had no help or suggestions. Restaurant.. same behavior. Long waits to get seated for dinner, drinks or breakfast. Food is mediocre, seems microwaved, which is outrageous considering the prices and that many of the dishes are at any other Hilton. Rooms, however, are large and very nicely"
381,"From the time we arrived until we left, every aspect of our visit was excellent. The location is perfect right off Michigan Avenue allowing easy access to anything you might want. My wife and I stayed in a regular room with two double beds. The rooms are exceptional, very clean, with plenty of room. There is plenty of storage and plenty off room to move around. The bathrooms are very spacious, well laid out and very clean.  This will be our go to hotel moving forward when we come into the city."
382,"I can only hope my experience was due to having appointments in the early am and came back for my complimentary breakfast. I have stayed here many times and since no lounge credit, but that has now changed to Continental Breakfast in restaurant. I was bunk big mistake as I always spend more then the credit.  My biggest disappointment was only one option for hot, and little cereal and few pastries. Fruit was decent but the oatmeal was not good and I know only oatmeal would have given me no options had I not been off my dietary restrictions. They need more options and oatmeal was awfu! Beware of this if you consider what is otherwise a great property.  "
383,"Booked this hotel for several reasons.  It is part of the Hilton Hotel family (a trusted staple for me), they offered a great price (which was a pleasant surprise for Thanksgiving week), the location just off of Michigan Ave was perfect for walking everywhere (and next door to the world's largest Starbucks if that's your thing).  But, the Conrad Chicago is so much more than a typical Hilton hotel.  It felt very much like a boutique hotel.  The rooms (we had 2) were spacious and comfortable; the bathrooms and toiletry items were luxurious.  Valet parking was $70/day so I would recommend self-parking at a nearby public parking garage or skip the car all together unless you really need one.   The restaurant, Baptiste & Bottle, offered a continental breakfast buffet and/or menu"
384,We wanted a great location (which happens to be right next to the new Starbucks Roastery) where we could walk to shops and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Our room was quite spacious (500+SF) with large windows overlooking the city. This new hotel has a boutique feel with very friendly and accommodating staff. We're coming back next year!
385,"Very impressive hotel. Rooms are top notch--clean, spacious. Bathroom has a nice supply of towels and separate tub and shower. You would be hard pressed to find anything wrong with the Conrad. Location is excellent--near Rush St and Michigan Ave."
386,"I will second many of the poor reviews regarding this hotel. While the room was very nice and clean, the food service was beyond HORRIBLE. We went to the restaurant the day we checked in for drinks, and the waitress didn't smile and was very short with us. We ordered four drinks, iced tea, beer, and two Shirley Temples. This took over 20 minutes, and there were maybe three other parties in the entire restaurant. The next morning, we  waited over 45 minutes for a table to have breakfast. As we walked back to our table, there were many other tables open, so I was confused why it took so long. As others have mentioned, the continental breakfast for Diamond members was pathetic. Most of the items were picked over, and there we no bowls, plates, or spoons. My son got the French"
387,This is the third time that I stayed in this hotel. The food and beverage service of the hotel  worsened dramatically compared to previous years and you are not at all getting 5 star hotel service. Despite of many calls we could not reach anybody for ordering room service. Every morning we had to wait 20 minutes for getting into breakfast room and another 30 minutes for just getting bagels !!! We wanted to talk to food and beverage manager and the answer was he or she was very busy ??? No proper answer or call back to our complaint letter. They just send a phone number and asked to call them after 1 day we check out from the hotel.  To sum up  the hotel is not any more the Hilton Conrad it used to be and I would not recommend to anybody expecting 5 star hotel service.
388,"Let's make this crisp and easy to absorb:  1. The rooms are supposed to have bathrobes. It's on the housekeeping inventory. If they're not there when I check in, I will mention it so that I am not charged for pilfering. If on subsequent days they're still not in the rooms, I will determine that there is a communications issue between housekeeping and the front desk. Or a systemic issue of Not Giving a Fig.  2. Why is the a/c not cooling between midnight and 3AM? Every night.  3. Why isn't anyone responding to multiple requests to see why the a/c is not cooling between midnight and 3AM?  4. In room dining: Forgetting utensils. Forgetting catsup despite requesting it. Twice. Old, cold french fries. Wrong burger sent. Salmon barely cooked-slimy and slick inside and I value my"
389,"This is absolutely a fantastic hotel, but it's not a true five star hotel. The bell staff at the door is helpful, but not as helpful as they could be. The reception staff are helpful, but not too helpful.  The reception is on the 20th floor, but the rooms are below the reception. The lobby has a beautiful view, but it was not terribly inviting. The restaurant on the 20th floor had breakfast for Hilton elite members, but I was made to feel like a second class citizen for partaking in it, and it was a relatively poor continental breakfast. I would much rather receive a credit for the restaurant than a continental breakfast that the waitstaff judge you for ordering.  I received an ""upgrade"" to a Michigan Avenue facing room on the 16th floor. The room was very well appointed, the"
390,"Overall this is a very nice looking hotel but the service is definitely subpar. I recently stayed with my wife and I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member but this property does not give any value to tier status.   At the time of checkin, they were unable to offer a same day upgrade or even a high floor room. The server at the bar was extremely rude to myself as well as our friends we brought to the hotel for drinks. They offer free breakfast for Diamond members however this is a TERRIBLE breakfast. The breakfast only includes mini pastries, milk, cereal, etc. We asked if we could upgrade and pay a difference, however, that was not an allowed option so we purchased the alternate hot breakfast at full menu price. We also asked for late check out on the day of our checkout and were"
391,Came to celebrate my husband’s birthday and thanksgiving  We have spent 30 minutes to discover the valet weren’t in their spot with no room to leave our car. They have double booked us And the room is nelly and full of dust Not a proper happy birthday welcome  Certainly not a 5 star hotel service
392,We were so pleased with the treatment by the hotel staff.  We felt like valued customers.  From the moment we went to the 20th floor we felt welcomed.  Never had to open to door to come in the building or leave for the day.
393,"This is a newly Conrad Hotel in Chicago for several years now.  It's a very nice hotel and good for work-related functions - Save place to rest, good shower, warm room, comfortable bed.  I had stayed here several times whenever I traveled to Chicago for work. I enjoyed the breakfast restaurant but it could be improved.  The room was small for the amount of money paid.  I don't think it was value-added given my status with Hilton hotel.  I don't recommend this hotel unless you are desperate to find a luxurious hotel to stay at in high season.  The staffs here should be educated to learn more about what it is like to work at a high-end hotel.  The staffs sometime could be clueless, unimaginative, and entitled."
394,"Pros:  Modern hotel, Great bar; especially bartender Zak, another Conrad bear to add to the ever-growing collection.  Cons:  Where to start?  Overall, hotel is not worthy of the “Conrad” name.  terrible service, front desk staff rude and accuses guests of lying, no sincere Diamond benefits, hotel nickels and dimes guests.  Detailed:  We arrived at the Conrad Chicago late Friday evening for a two-night stay.  We visit Chicago several times a year and typically stay the Palmer House which is another Hilton property.  We decided to try the Conrad as we have had wonderful experiences at all the other Conrad’s we have previously stayed at.   The door staff were polite and let the front desk staff know of our impending arrival.  Front desk staff was pleasant at check in; however,"
395,"Good experience other than hearing some noise from a room next door. Staff took care of it. Nice toiletries, plenty of storage space, nice views, good location, friendly staff, classy decor. I would return and recommend this place to others."
396,Excellence Is the best word I can use to describe Conrad! I’ve stayed at several hotels in Chicago and this one stands out!! I look forward to my next visit! Now the new giant Starbucks Reserve is right next door! 
397,My first experience with the Conrad Chicago. Very nice room at a fair price in a great location. Friendly and welcoming staff. Only stayed one night this time. Will definitely stay there again next time I’m in Chicago.
398,"You can never go wrong with a Conrad. And the staff here are really on top of things. Had a standard king room this time but standard here is quite satisfactory. I’m picky about bathrooms and I love their bathrooms. I’ve stayed in a skyline suite here, and if you get the chance, you should. It’s a great view, a beautiful room(s) and nicer than my apartment."
399,"The arrival process went so smooth...and we didn’t get in until 1 am! The room service was excellent and we used it at least once a day for convenience and it’s quick delivery. I loved our view, the room was fantastic and the key pad used to put our room on private, call for tray pick up, have our room made up, etc. was so nice. They even texted us two different days to see if we needed anything for our room since we had our room on private/do not disturb. We will MOST DEFINITELY be back again. "
400,"Luckily I only stayed one night.   Front desk attention and service was great, but the overall style of the hotel is outdated and old. The carpets in the rooms need to be changed ASAP, the shower/bathroom area was quite small, it felt almost European. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows.   Had breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and it was rather disappointing, the food wasn’t good.   On the other hand the location is pretty great."
401,"Celebrated my birthday in Chicago and decided to stay at this hotel. Had a wonderful experience from Check in to check out. Received a room upgrade that had stunning views of Millenium Park! The door man, Barry was awesome! He helped answer any question about where to go and how to get there. Always had a smile on. "
402,"We always have great luck at Fairmont’s but not this time. The furniture in the rooms and the bathrooms felt very dated. No coffee maker, no house keeping unless you ask for it, no parking on site and only two pillows on a king bed (so 1 pillow each). I get it, covid precautions but this just seems excessive. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough. We left and checked in to Trump International the very next morning. They had all the amenities I expect when traveling. "
403,"This hotel will not disappoint you. I had my room upgraded to the gold room.  Which I had met the 4 amazing people in my life.  They did not make you feel like a guest. So much more like family. Alexander Mcandrews, Mandana Kaydi, and Tiphani. They had the best hospitality in the world. They make you never want to leave the Fairmont chicago. Also huge shout out to Cody an amazing sweet person also. Make sure you say hi to them and for sure you will feel the same way I do as soon as you meet them."
404,"I stayed 4 nights in June 2018 while attending SHRM18 Chicago. The hotel was beautiful! My room had an amazing view that faced the pier/lake as well as far north downtown. It was in walking distance to many neat attarctions and dining. The marble spa styled bathroom included was amazing! There is not a pool on site, and parking is undergound, but i would definitely return. I had the best time, and did not want to leave!"
405,"My suite overlooked Millenium Park, which was a short walk out the main door. Every inch of the hotel was clean and modern. Friendly, efficient staff at every interaction. Delicious food spanning many kinds of cuisine across the length of my conference. Thoughtful amenities like a light-up makeup mirror and shoe cleaning station really enhanced the room experience. The public lounge areas were also spacious and comfortable to grab a few minutes of laptop or phone work or just to gaze at the city views. A hotel that manages to maintain both a sense of vintage history and gilded modernity that makes for a perfect stay."
406,Wonderful stay.  Luxurious hotel without being pretentious.  Combination of comfort and style.  The staff was courteous and available without being noticeable.  Location can't be beat.  Amenities are second to none.  Can't wait to come back!
407,"Excellent staff - very friendly and helpful - and great accommodations. I was surprised at how well laid out the room was, and it didn't feel cramped like most city hotels. Also, the food was excellent at the restaurant, the room service, and the events held at the hotel. What more can you ask for?"
408,"My stay was seamless from start to finish.  The hotel was in great shape, staff was kind, and operations ran smoothly and without a hitch.  Fairmont has once again proven that they are the best of the best!"
409,"Hotel lobby and restaurant are nice and swanky.  The overall quality of guest rooms, hallways, bathrooms have room for improvement.  The concierge, Gail Walker, is on top of her game, always remembered us and gave very helpful recommendations!  "
410,"Had a 2 night stay here with my sister, and loved it! The room was gorgeous, we had a corner suite, and everything was extremely clean, modern, and elegant looking. Turndown service was provided, even though we didn't request it, and it was lovely! The staff were very pleasant and helpful, and I loved the feel of the lobby. The location of the hotel is also absolutely ideal - it's central to everything, and I felt very safe the whole time.  On our first night, we had an issue with the room next door who decided it was a good idea to throw a loud room party late into the evening/morning. Having just got off an 8-hour flight, we were very tired, and so called reception to see what was happening. 5 minutes later, staff immediately came to see to the room next door and resolve the"
411,Our room was lovely and large. We had a suite that included 2 beds and a separate room with a pullout couch and table. The view was great. A little bit of the city to the right and straight ahead was the lake. All staff was very friendly and helpful.  Awesome stay. I will return.
412,I loved being within walking distance to Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. Alexander at the front desk was especially helpful with local coffee shop and nearby shopping recommendations.
413,"Great hotel with nice accommodation. Staff very accommodating and pleasant. Nicer than normal gym. Great location in the heart of Chicago. Very clean and spacious rooms.Bathrooms, slippers and umbrellas supplied!"
414,Stayed at this hotel for a conference.   The guest rooms were much nicer than I expected for the group rate that I paid.   Bedding was very comfortable and the bathrooms were a nice size for a downtown hotel.  Staff was friendly throughout my stay.
415,"amazing locations, great views -  we stayed at 38th floor and it was amazing, the booking through Booking.com was a bit messy but it may be caused by booking .com  staff were helpfull and all very great experience, overall"
416,Could not check in at 5PM. When I checked in at 7PM could not get my luggage. An other 20 minutes of waiting and more frustration. To top it all off no lounge access for Diamond accor member. They really do everything possible to not make you feel welcome. Maybe its because Im not from USA so they look down on me. My conclusion please avoid this hotel by any means!!!
417,We recently got an invite to the black tie opening for the Chicago auto show. After enjoying endless food and drink and many beautiful cars that you could actually sit in.  We chose to stay at the nearby Fairmont Hotel.  We stayed on the gold level 15th floor. Which has a delicious hot breakfast and a light dinner included with the room at an affordable price.   The view was fantastic and the bed was even better.   We live in the greatest city in the world.
418,"Farimont Gold staff and lounge experience was outstanding, hotel well located, clean and welcoming, if a bit dated in some of the decor. Very much appreciated the quick check-in and check-out and really very friendly staff."
419,"Very nice hotel in a great location.  We walked everywhere and it was located right in the heart of the action.  Easy check-in and lovely room.  Upon leaving, we left our bag with bell captain and it was again very easy."
420,The hotel was very accommodating to the conference I attended.  The housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping my room fully supplied and clean.  Appreciate them.  The rooms and beds were comfortable.  I enjoyed having 24 hour access to the fitness center as well.  I would stay here on a return trip either professional or personal.
421,"Loved the rooms, friendly helpful staff, concierge was really great. definitely recommend!!! The rooms are really large and love the stone tile in the bathroom. Such a great value for the money in January."
422,"I’ve stayed here 10 or so times now since I visit Chicago a lot. There is nothing horrible about the hotel, it has just become very run down. The elevator today had the call box door broken and hanging open. The carpets in the rooms are worn, and there are scuffed walls everywhere. You can see the photo of my room. It looks like a roadside inn.   The people are lovely and friendly, and it is in a great location. Just don’t kid yourself that this is a luxury hotel. It is far from it. "
423,"Had a brief stay here on business. Check in was a breeze despite late arrival. Room was pleasant, feels like an old school Ritz (separate shower bath and a door that closes for toilet). Room was reasonably spacious as well. Location can’t be beat. Didn’t do much to test the customer service or housekeeping since it was a one day stay, but would come again."
424,"The hotel is located in Chicago Downtown, very close to Millenium Park where the Bean (Cloud Gate) is located. A couple minutes walking you will reach the reach the Chicago riverwalk and the Michigan Avenue (the Magnificent Mile). The people are friendly, the service is good, and also it was safe walking around the area at night. All in all it was a good experience. If you need breakfast, there's a Deli called Bockwinkel's just behind the hotel open from 7AM. The sandwiches are good.  Warning: for people from South East Asia region, who are used to the 5-star experiences in hotels throughout SEA, you will find yourself comparing the services and the amenities. My suggestion is, DON'T. Different customs, just enjoy the location and the friendliness of the staff,"
425,This was the second year our group was at the hotel and it was another fantastic experience.  The banquets and events team are top notch and the food was yet again another hit with everyone who attended.  I am sure we'll be back next year.
426,"I’m always on the hunt for good skin services. Living in the city, my skin gets rough and clogged from all the environmental factors. Couple being someone someone with sensitive skin, I struggle to find someone whose able to give me an effective facial without leaving my skin red and irritated. Alexis is a skincare angel sent from above! She was incredibly educated on all the products used and easily swapped out products that she suspected would irritate my skin. Not only was my skin irritation free at the end of my visit, but I kept getting compliments on how clear, glowy, and glass-like my skin looked afterwards. I immediately booked another appointment with Alexis!!"
427,"My wife and I enjoyed a three day’s stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park in Chicago. We upgraded to the Gold level, and it was more than worth it! All staff members and management were outstanding. And access to Millenium Park as well as the rest of downtown Chicago makes this a great place to stay when exploring the Windy City. Thanks to all of you, and we are looking forward to our next visit!"
428,Everything was amazing about the stay - I received an unexpected upgrade to a suite. The space was luxurious and the bed was so comfortable. I also enjoyed the Le Labo toiletries and the tea selection. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful - they made me feel welcomed and valued during my stay. 
429,Another great stay at the Fairmont Chicago.  Special thanks to Mugi and the Reception Staff as well as Patrick and. Gold Lounge Staff for attending to all the details !  Knowing my preferences for my stays is big factor in why I return and will continue to do so.  
430,"I have stayed at this hotel the last 3 times I have visited Chicago and have never been disappointed.  This trip we had an issue shortly after checking in, which was no fault of the hotel or their staff.  The people in the neighbouring room decided to smoke marijuana in their room shortly after arriving, which created a strong odour in our room.  A smell our daughter could not tolerate. We went down to the front desk on our way out for the evening and although we didn’t want to make a fuss, Hyon at the front desk handled our concerns perfectly.  Not only was she extremely sympathetic to our concerns she provide us with several acceptable options to address our concerns.    On top of the excellent customer service provided by Hyon and all other staff we have encountered on our"
431,Traveling on a road trip we stopped in Chicago and stayed a night at the Fairmont.  Great rates and the gold rooms are worth the extra charge. The gold lounge was great and had wonderful views of the city.  
432,"We stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park for three nights around the Christmas Holiday.  The location was very convenient to a number of attractions in Downtown Chicago, including the ice skating ribbon at Maggie Daley Park, Christkindl, the River Walk, The Art Institute as well as shopping on State Street and Michigan Avenue.  One minor issue is that while the area is busy during the day, there is pretty limited foot traffic around the hotel at night so we typically took Uber back at night rather than walking.  Our Gold Room was clean and spacious and the Gold Lounge had a wonderful breakfast and other snacks throughout the day.  I particularly appreciated the service by Hyon at the front desk, who made check in a breeze and went above and beyond to ensure that we enjoyed our"
433,"I've spent one night on a business trip. I arrived late at night, and the reception personnel was accommodating and friendly. The room was upgraded to a beautiful room. I will return, a great location and view."
434,We stayed here for an event at Millennium Park. The location is perfect since it's right across from the park on the north side.  The room is larger than normal. The bathroom has a big tub and decent sized shower. The bed is very comfy. We felt like we were sleeping on clouds.  Would definitely come back and stay here again.
435,a great place to come home to- the gold floor lounge spoiled my 4 year old granddaughter rotten; the conciere in the lounge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable with reservations and best times to go to the different venues - nice!
436,Our family stayed on the Gold Floor for the week of Christmas and had a wonderful time! The hospitality that Mandana shared each day made our week special! Mandana is a true representative of the Fairmont culture!
437,"From the moment we were greeted by Nino at Fairmont hotel in Chicago, to our room, to the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries...everything has been amazing. Special thanks to Gail the concierge who helped us with different recommendations on food and entertainment in Chicago. Everything and everyone was wonderful!"
438,"What happened to this once beautiful and lovely hotel?!?! We stayed for a night and the hotel was decked out for the holidays. But, there was no holiday spirit. The front desk personnel were void of personality and only wanted to work the computer system. Escalators were turned off.  There was no welcoming atmosphere that you would expect from such a “luxury” hotel.   We went to the hotel restaurant and were promptly seated. We waited 20 minutes and were only acknowledged once we got up to leave for the hotel restaurant (Filini) across the street. And, the restaurant personnel looked right at us after we were seated. Our room had (what we guessed) was the hotel cleaning crew's hair on our toilet seat and in the bathroom sink. AND...we were charged a ""amenity"" fee of $20. When I"
439,Fantastic amenities.  The spa is a truly wonderful thing. The staff was exceptional.  Vitaly and Melissa were fabulous.   I enjoyed my seaweed wrap with Vitaly and waxing with Melissa. Check in and check out was great too. Just a wonderful end to a long business trip.
440,"From the moment we arrive the staff was friendly and outgoing. The hotel is in a great location and the room was perfect for our stay. If possible, I will always stay at a Fairmont! The Gold Lounge is a real treat. "
441,"The Fairmont is primarily a business hotel during the week so it was nice and quiet for our Saturday night stay.   We checked in early which we really appreciated.  The person who checked us in was very nice.  The room was very nice, clean and a good size.   We were upgraded to a room with a better view, also a nice touch.  The only negative was no mini fridge so there was no place to store our leftovers.   Also, the restaurant  service was not the greatest.   Personnel was inexperienced and it took a long time to get our food.   Also, they advertised a brunch but it was not being served that day.   The management needs to do a better job for the guests using the restaurant. "
442,"From the arrival hello by the doorman , Harry,  till his final goodbye, staying at the millennium was purely magical. Very attentive staff, beautifully appointed rooms, quiet and peaceful and yet right in the very energetic heart of downtown Chicago. How much more connected can one be?"
443,"Great view of city and lake, close to millennium park, attentive and well trained staff, easy walk to mag mile shopping and restaurants, a few minor details like towels and linens could be updated, good fitness center "
444,"Classy hotel on an excellent location. Spaceous rooms and hallways, excellent service. Service and quality according to room rate. Columbus tap is a nice bar, but lobbu bar shouls also be opened most of the time."
445,"My husband decided to pay for gold lounge upgrade for our anniversary stay this past weekend. While it was a nice perk, there ended up being several glaring negatives.   First, we had asked for a quiet room far from the elevators- which was true, for the guest elevators, but unknown to us we were placed almost directly across from the service room and we were woken up at ~6am with tremendous clamor/noise/plate clanking. We went out into the hallway to find it was the staff setting up breakfast! Not exactly the restful sleep you want for a celebratory weekend, and this just set the tone for the rest of the morning.  Next, the gold lounge has a ""write down your room number for alcoholic beverages"" as an honor policy system.. .both my husband and I did not drink alcohol at the"
446,"The Fairmont in Chicago is all you would expect from a Fairmont.  Service is great, rooms are excellent and location is perfect.  Great place to stay if you need a downtown hotel.  Millenium Park across the street and water views are a real plus."
447,"Very convenient to Aon Center. Rooms are modern, well kept and comfortable. Concierge lounge on 15th floor had an excellent array of food and beverages throughout the day. Hotel staff was personable, attentive and helpful for all requests. Thank you Fairmont Chicago for an excellent stay. "
448,I adored this hotel.  Everyone was the perfect combination of professional but welcoming.  I was here for a conference and the conference services were outstanding as well.  I'd come back in a minute.  Perfect location to walk everywhere too.
449,"Location can't be beat. Being so close to the best attractions in the Loop such as Grant Park, Magnificent Mile, and the river gives you access to countless things to do. I thought the room was very clean and comfortable and I would stay again."
450,"Very comfortable home away from home, but a little pricey with the food and in room refreshments.  Normally would book at a different hotel, but overall experience was good.  The staff was very welcoming and room was clean."
451,"Stayed for three nights; very big hotel but friendly staff at check-in and my room was of a good size with a big bathroom, good shower and comfy bed. All very clean and well presented. Disappointed that no swimming pool in a hotel of this size and the fitness area is underwhelming.  More Holiday Inn than what I'd expect from a Fairmont. Good bar/pub in the lobby.  Nice beers, friendly staff.  Colleague ate and said it was good.  Would stay again."
452,"I really like Fairmonts. When my wife and I travel, if the city has a Fairmont, its typically where we stay. With that, we've been to some beautiful properties (Lake Louise, Banff, San Francisco). Now with that being said, this is a lovely hotel. It may not have the grandiose as some of the other properties, but the staff is incredible, the rooms immaculate, and you can walk or train anywhere in the city. Next time in Chicago, I know where I am staying."
453,"Great View of the Park, even as just a basic room booking.  Nice to have a separate shower and bath and coffee and TV with Streaming access.  Everything you’d expect of a Fairmont and enjoyed the Beer place downstairs as well.  Not overly grand and giant feeling, but quite cozy.  Location is a short 5 min stroll to things, not directly on top of them, but that’s actually pleasant. Altogether highly recommend."
454,"Stayed here a couple of nights for a conference.  This is a large, somewhat older hotel in a convenient location near Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue shops.  It’s not glitzy or modern, but they’ve kept it up. My first room was too cold, and they cheerfully moved me to another room.  Rooms are spacious, with nice bathrooms and large flat screen TVs. WiFi is free, worked well.  Minibar fridge is electronic so they’ll charge you if you take anything out.  Nice fitness center.  Staff are very helpful and friendly.  I arrived late for what I thought was a buffet lunch at my conference, and they made me a fresh new meal.  Conference food was excellent. CVS is across the street, and a well-stocked market is around the corner (Bockwinkels).    Overall, this is not at the level of"
455,"I stayed on a business trip last week and the Fairmont was perfect. A great workspace for me to answer my emails, prompt room service with excellent food, and all of the staff were so friendly. I'll be staying here when I return."
456,"My husband and I came to Chicago for a wedding and decided to stay for the weekend at the Fairmont. We booked a room on the 37th floor in one of their suites and we were both blown away by the views, suite, and service. The valet was wonderful taking care of our bags and car, the check in staff were great and our room was ready 4 hours earlier than expected. We also had access to the gold members lounge and the staff and food there were excellent! We were only there for 2 nights and 3 days for a wedding but we both felt like we were on vacation. This was our first time staying in Chicago as well as our first time staying in a Fairmont hotel. We definitely want to make a trip back to the Fairmont Chicago and plan on visiting other Fairmont locations in the future."
457,"At check in, we met Cody at the reception desk and he was extremely accommodating.  In addition to making the check-in experience seamless, he made out dinner reservations for that night and even checked in with us later to ensure we had an enjoyable evening.  Well done!"
458,"Spent a few days there while running the Chicago Marathon. Staff is professional, pleasant and the rooms are well appointed and clean. The in-hotel restaurant is a little pricey but the food and service are excellent. Only disappointment is I believe they raised their normal rates due to the marathon being in town."
459,"Room very small, no fridge. Very tired room. Horrendous customer service with staff with disgruntled attitude. This is not a 4star hotel. Location was excellent, close to magnificent mile. Good vibe on entrance but that quickly diminishes. Me and my friend booked twin room and ended up with double. "
460,The view was nice. The room was clean. The service was good. The staff was nice and helpful. Lots of great restaurants close by and within walking distance. Lots of great stores to go shopping too. Enjoyed my stay.
461,"A pick from the internet turned out great. Get a GOLDEN room, breakfast, afternnon snacks and after dinner sweets are includet. You can walk to many interestng locations. Use a taxi to get arround ( Car rental is about $ 60.- per day and hotel parking $ 50.-) You have $ 110.- to spend on cabs. No worry about parking or how to get where you want to go. The hotel is mid range but better located then some of the more luxury places."
462,"Came for a conference, booked a Gold suite. Arrived quite early on a Sat, had already emailed in advance to try and take advantage of platinum early check-in. Asked the door man if we should check in at main reception or Gold Lounge, he advised us to go on up. Unfortunately the lady working there at the time said she had no registration privileges, she was normally at concierge desk. But she took our info and offered to go downstairs and check us in while we waited in the lounge. Came back 5 mins later and said our room wasn't ready. I asked if she had an idea when it may be, she wasn't sure, but then said something that made it sound like maybe she never even talked with anyone downstairs. I think that it was really busy and she couldn't get to the people working at reception."
463,"I stayed at Fairmont for work but just to get the invoice for my stay I had to go through hell. When I called the person answering the phone and even the hotel manager was extremely rude, put me on hold for more than 10 minutes. I had to get the invoice for the expenses to be approved. Horrible staff would never stay there."
464,"The Fairmont is in such a great location it’s a short walk to a lot of the places you must see when you visit this great city!   The hotel is truly a 5 Star property clean, beautiful and everyone here couldn’t be nicer or more helpful in making our first time in Chicago the best.  I highly recommend the Fairmont if you are planning a trip to Chicago."
465,"We stayed one night for a concert in downtown Chicago.  We are Disney Vacation Club members and used our points to book the room using their Concierge Collection.  We had a Gold King room which offered not only a great room but access to the Gold Lounge.  Tiffany and Jesus in the lounge took good care of us at both the afternoon tea time and the early evening canape time.  Both times there was plenty of food to satisfy us and a great selection of teas to choose from.  Our room was very clean, comfortable and offered a great view of the lake.  Before checking out in the morning we took advantage of the lounge once again for breakfast.  Highly recommend this hotel."
466,"Our suite was spectacular with views of the water and millennium Park thanks to Bradley Russell , Alexander checked us in efficiently and with an upbeat manner.  The concierge Álex made arrangements for a boat tour and answered all our questions.   Fabulous Hotel we highly recommend"
467,"It was my first time staying at a Fairmont Hotel, and this experience did not disappoint! When I arrived, I was immediately assisted with my bags and the staff was very friendly when I checked in. I enjoyed staying at the 31st floor since it had amazing window views of the city! Also, if you have the opportunity to, I would suggest indulging for the king size bed if you're solo traveling at Fairmont Chicago (the mattresses were so comfy). As far as my trip itinerary goes, the staff was very helpful in suggesting to me great sightseeing and food spots! Also, SO many sightseeing spots in Chicago (such as The Bean/Cloud Gate and Buckingham Fountain) were a 10 minute walk from the hotel! If you get the chance to, I would also suggest trying out Columbus Tap, which is also located"
468,"This Fairmont (just like all Fairmont hotels we have stayed in), is excellent. The rooms are spacious, well decorated and clean. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Special mention to Mugi, Abraham and Mandana in the lounge on the 13th floor for going beyond what we could expect.  We asked the concierge for a fridge in our room and a guy appeared at the door 10 minutes later with a fridge. We also requested a kettle (we are English and prefer tea to coffee) and that was also delivered quickly - and no extra charge for either of these items. If you are going to Chicago, stay at the Fairmont. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it. We stayed in 8 hotels on our trip to the USA in June/July and the 2 Fairmonts (Seattle and Chicago) were by far the best of them."
469,"For the most part this is a wonderful hotel in a great location. Pros and cons:  PROS -Nice view of the city -Good location, easy to find and get to. There is a CVS across the street for all your last-minute needs -Close to Millennium Park -Friendly staff -My room had a sound machine, which I did not use but is a nice touch for those city stays -Great, fast free wifi! -I was also given a free drink card coupon upon check-in -Room came equipped with hair dryer, robe, soaps, iron and ironing board, etc.  CONS -Room did not include a mini fridge. I called the front desk to ask if I was missing it and they told me there was a $30/night upcharge to have a fridge in my room. There was a fridge stocked with a mini bar, but not for personal use -Hotel does not offer continental"
470,"This property is in a clean, safe and modern neighborhood....feet from the Aon building and 2 blocks from the river. Check-in was unpleasant. The agent did take the time carefully read that we reserved a Gold 1BR suite. He attempted to charge us for 2 upgrades. One for lounge access and another for a higher floor. This could have been either gross incompetence on his part or a money grab hotel directive. Either one is bad. Once that was sorted out, we enjoyed our stay. The suite was large. The view of the park was impressive. The club lounge was pleasant and nicely furnished. Breakfast was more than adequate. Evening appetizers were varied but not enough to provide a meal. This sparsity seems to be the trend of chain executive lounges these days. The staff in the lounge was"
471,Brian Culberson concert at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium. Love the Hotel. very clean and modern. The Bar area was very accessible. Bartenders were very efficient. Just had a wonderful time. the Hotel Staff was so friendly. I Love to have stayed at the Hotel. everyone I came in contact at the Hotel was courteous.
472,"Lovely hotel with fab views of Grant Park. If you can upgrade to a Signature 1 bedroom suite, it is very spacious. Very clean hotel and centrally located for most of the major attractions. Super comfortable beds and the bathrooms are nice. "
473,The Fairmont chain must have replaced their pillows - now very uncomfortable and hard to sleep on.  Had the same problem at the Seattle Fairmont.  Must be an Accor hotel change.  May have to avoid this chain!  
474,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  The staff were very friendly and attentive to any requests (we asked for a mini-frig).  I went running in the mornings and when I came bak to the hotel the bellman hands me a hand towel and bottle of water.  Close to everything. Millenium Park right across the street. The Miracle Mile shopping/restaurant two blocks away and Chicago River a block away.  If it's a nice day, try walking to the museum section. It's a little ovwer a mile and about a 30 minute walk.  Highly recommend."
475,The carpet on the stairs in the event area has worn through. The phone in my room didn't work. Room service came to my room twice with the same order - I had to turn the second guy away. The hotel isn't quite what I remember it. Has lost some of its charm.
476,"Room was fantastic with a great view. The location of the Fairmont is perfect and plenty of shopping and sightseeing all around. 5 minute walk to ""The Bean"". Immaculate amenities with a great gym and spa area. Overall hotel is very large with restaurants in and near by. Would recommend a quick weekend getaway here."
477,"We had a very special wedding to attend in Chicago and 7 of us from out of town were attending. I booked a queen suite with an attached king. The accommodation was very nice and it all went off without a hitch (once I hooked up the kids with WiFi). I would not call the rooms luxurious by any means, but only because places like The Canyons in Park City, UT and The Mayflower in D.C. have probably spoiled me.  Easy access to The bean (AKA Cloudgate), Buckingham Fountain, Michigan Ave and Navy Pier.  The room was very quiet and the bedding was wonderful."
478,"The Fairmont is a nice hotel, but it is expensive. If you are attending an event in one of the connecting properties it's convenient.  It's a bit of a walk to get to public transportation. The bed was comfortable and they provide robes for your stay. "
479,"I recently stayed here for four nights with a family group of ten.We were all happy with our rooms,mine in particular was spacious with a comfortable king size bed and large bathroom.There’s a pleasant bar in the lobby,ideal for a quiet cocktail but our main meeting place was the Columbus Tap with its large range of craft beers and very professional bar staff.We also had breakfast there on a couple of occasions as well as whole range of bar snacks while watching football.The hotel is in an ideal location,very close to the Loop business district but equally convenient for Michigan Avenue with its shops to the north and The Field Musem,Art Institute and Shedd Aquarium to the south.Whether you’re here for business or as we were,pleasure,the location is hard to beat.We would all be"
480,"Stayed here twice, in 2016 and 2019. Very pretty hotel full of history. Value for money. It's further than expected from the 'central' area though, I misjudged the scale on the map, and it was a 45 mins walk to where I had to be for the week at Aon Center. But it was a nice walk, wouldn't do it in winter."
481,"Cannot say enough good things about our recent 5 night stay at the Chicago Hilton.  Great location, great service, great price.  From my first contact with Candace (front desk mgr), I felt like a valued customer.  Our daughter was graduating from Med School - and I wanted everything to be perfect.  Alicia (diamond desk) was super helpful, friendly and was able to answer my every question.  Bellmen Rufus and Stephen kept us going in the right directions and always had a helpful tip or suggestion.  Our rooms were delightful and we adored the view of the lake (not many big lakes in our home town of Las Vegas). As obvious “out-of-towners”,  we felt like our home base in Chicago was there to take care of us.  Highly recommend.  Will absolutely choose this hotel again on our next trip"
482,"We loved the hotel. We went right before christmas 2019 and the hotel was beautiful. It was interesting to explore the hotel and the decorations. The hotel is very large and interesting to see. It was far enough to not be in the crowded downtown but still close enough to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Room was excellent, much larger than we expected and plenty space for all christmas shopping and to relax."
483,"We visited Chicago Illinois for the 1st time and we were nervous, our 1st experience with our children and we wanted it to be great worrying about our hotel experience was one problem we hoped would not be an issue and it wasn't. Thanks Simeon and Allen for taking very good care of us making sure our room had a refrigerator making sure our bill was accurate. We were very pleased with this hotel the location was great the view was amazing of the city and we plan to stay here again. Thank You guys for helping us feel relaxed and welcome."
484,"Room was huge and well appointed.  The concierge service was really good, and when it snowed hard one day we could while away time exploring the massive facility. The indoor, heated pool also came in handy on this day. A short walk from Yolk (which we love) and right across the road from the Park and Fountain. Easy walk to the Museums and the Aquarium too. A great spot for a good walking, family holiday."
485,"First time staying at this Hilton and our stay was fantastic. Superb service, especially from the restaurant staff. The chef prepared for us a huge dessert the moment he saw us with our White Sox fear and immediately greeted us. We felt right at home. Special thanks to Mario, Thomas, and Jay for always taking such good care of us during breakfast. The food was amazing. The only hassle during the stay was having to wait so long to check in and also to see someone from front desk whenever we needed to get our key reprogrammed (15-20mins waiting time)."
486,One of the amazing hotel must takes stay in this hotel when you visit Chicago staff is very good over your the food is very good. the hospitalityis we nice  I'll give a big Thumbs Up this hotel. I'll highly recommend this hotel
487,I had a very comfortable stay at this hotel and I will definitely recommend it to all the tourist visit in Chicago this hotel is simply amazing and the hotel is right at the centre and the heart of the city. A big thumbs up
488,"Even though the weather was chilly, the room was cozy and warm with a fantastic view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier!  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Had dinner at Kitty O’Sheas and the service and the food were both excellent!  A very fun atmosphere!"
489,"I was impressed by the whole staff and would highly recommend Chicago Hilton as they were simply excellent. In particular, there was an employee named Julius Doxy who recognized that I was frustrated and took the appropriate action right away. It is the little things that count that make the difference in the end. Great stuff, Julius."
490,"We stayed 3 nights at the Hilton Chicago on S. Michigan for a mother/daughter trip. Hotel location is ideal across from a park. The marble entrance is so beautiful. By far the best part was the staff especially Carsarra H. at the front desk. She found us a room earlier than regular check-in and was so kind to find us an upgrade as well as get us a room closer to the elevator since my mom uses a cane. Thank you for taking such good care of us, we will definitely be back! 🙂"
491,Fun trip and good hotel experience overall except I had issues 1 day with housekeeping getting my room cleaned. I enjoyed the locations close proximity to the parks and great quick service food spots. 
492,"Excellent property, clean, friendly, great location and  will defiantly  come back to this location in the future. Food in hotel was great and service was friendly. Great view of the lakefront. Bus service right outside front door."
493,"We had the most wonderful, and relaxing stay at the Hilton Chicago. Everyone on the staff were always willing to go the little extra out of their way to ensure we had a fabulous stay. For example, Jessica the tour guide for the historic hotel walking tour was amazing and knowledgeable about the hotel’s rich Chicago history. She went completely out of her way and took us up to the executive suites at the very top of the hotel with the amazing views over the park and lake! Quite the highlight! Highly recommend staying here to all, you wont be disappointed."
494,"Julius was extremely personable and made us feel very welcome. He gave us ideas of the best places to go in Chicago. The entire staff was delightful. Service like this, is what keeps bringing us back."
495,"I had an excellent stay at the Hilton Chicago this weekend, especially because of service I received from Ms Darnella Harper (in the fitness center), Tiffany (at the front desk), and Doy Edward Gildart (at the front desk). I will be back!"
496,"I love the Hilton Chicago, Mr.Doy was amazing he shared soo much information with me his customers service was amazing. He was able to answer all my questions , he kept a smile on my sister and i faces and i felt very welcomed to Chicago ."
497,"The hotel’s renovation is gorgeous, they’ve done a fantastic job of bringing modern and classic touches. I stayed here for work and the staff was professional and polite. There are two areas that need improvement 1. The room was missing some key items that such as towels. 2. This is the first hotel I’ve ever stayed at where a guest has to pay to use the gym, that is ridiculous. The gym is nothing extraordinary and making guests pay $15 per use is ridiculous."
498,"I was excited to book a weekend in Chicago with my husband. When we arrived, the first room we were assigned had long, black hair all over the bathroom sink, floor, and shower. It was evident that the bathroom had not been sanitized or clean. As someone with a background in hospitality, I understand these things happen. We went back downstairs and asked if we could change rooms. We went to our second room only to find that it was located in the elevator lobby (literally) and was a handicapped room with the cabinets thrown open and the furniture beginning to brake. We went down a THIRD time. We spoke with a different guest agent each time, and the third agent was absolutely horrible. She was rude and aggressive without listening to our concerns. We were finally reassigned to a"
499,Had a great visit to Chicago staying a the Hilton. Carsarra H at the Front Desk was very friendly and accommodating for my stay. Had a very nice room with a lake view. Several restaurants on site for business travelers. Would definitely come back!
500,Was here for a trade show checking in was a bit of a challenge as there were tons of us there trying to get in and registered. Carsarra was able to roll with the punches and get is taken care of and settled. Folks take for granted what people in the hospitality industry do.The staff here were able to manage our large group and still maintain everything else. It was well done and I appreciate the efforts.
501,We are having an excellent stay here! Each employee we have met has gone above and beyond for us. In particular Jay the maître d at 720 breakfast was lovely. He put us first and took great care of our family while we enjoyed our morning meal. While staying at the Hilton Chicago be sure to also have breakfast here. The food is amazing and the service is even more so.
502,"Around the hotel there was good security and those guys were polite, friendly and efficient. The same cannot be said for the Reception staff. I needed $3 for the left luggage and as I was on route back to the UK I did not want to get more currency. It ended up costing me £26 at their ATM for the $3 charge (cash only). I had to use it as check out was 11am, not the standard 12:00. I asked Reception to charge $3 to the room to give me the cash for the service. They said the left luggage was noting to do with them so use a ATM, even after I explained I did not want to pay for more US currency - most unhelpful."
503,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel! I was clean, comfortable, and virtually everything that you could ever need was located within the building itself. I stayed in a double room with a friend that, to our great surprise, only had one bed (not great), but everything else--the mattress, the bathroom, the fridge--were all good.   One thing to note: virtually everything other than the room itself costs money. If you are not a Hilton Honors member, you must pay for Wifi. You also must pay $15 per day to use the gym, unless you just want to run the track or swim in the pool. There were no water fountains in the building that I could find, so it's either free sink water or expensive bottled water."
504,"I have been to a number of Hilton properties around the US and this is by far the best. I received exceptional service from two people specifically, Julius Doxy and Marvin Carbajal. I travel all the time and I received great hospitality here which was really nice and hard to come by."
505,"Absolutely the best gym in all of Chicagoland hotels. Indoor pool, sauna, track (yes, a track) and every dumbbell/ anaerobic piece of equipment you could possibly want.   Oscar, who greats you at the sign in area is absolutely fantastic. His professionalism is only bested by his memory (remembered my name in-between three week stay).   Equipment is well maintained, cleaned daily and new (love the pelotons!).   I choose Hilton Chicago for the gym over my next favorite the Wit.   Great work Oscar!"
506,I recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while taking my son on a tour of one of the colleges nearby.  This was my second time staying in the hotel.  It's location near several colleges as well as the beautiful park was a plus.  The room was updated and clean.  It had 2 bathrooms which was a great perk with our 2 teens in the room. Check in was hassle free and we were offered the option of an upgrade to our room for a nominal fee which we declined but it was nice to have the option.  When we did have an issue with our room (the mini fridge wasn't working) maintenance came within a reasonable amount of time to address and fix the issue.  Staff was professional and friendly. Parking is available but we did not use it this time.  My biggest complaint was that there were Hilton
507,Very beautiful ball room. This hotel would make for a great place to have a wedding or an event. The staff was great and very friendly. I thought the rooms were very typical for most Hilton locations. Also a great place to get your shoes shined!
508,"I stayed here for a week (02-08 Feb) for business. The location is excellent, across from a beautiful park and within walking distance to good shops and restaurants. Additionally, the Irish pub inside of the hotel was great for late night drinks. The staff was very kind. My only complaint is that the fitness center was not included in the stay - seems very odd and penny pinching to me. For that reason, I will not be booking future business stays here."
509,"I've stayed hear a number of times, for business. The location is near to my business and the staff has always been friendly. But, this last trip was a nightmare. There was some type of guest kerfuffle that started around 1:00 am and went on for hours. That didn't leave me feeling like security had things under control. When I called reception, they sounded in a panic. (Ultimately, police were called and the guest was escorted out. But, this lasted WAY tooo long for comfort!!) Dishes - breakfast and dinner - were stacked in the hallways for days. Carpet had pieces of garbage on it for the duration - three days. Restaurants were closed - without warning, not even at check in. Room service, the same thing - closed. The temperature in the room was freezing. The elevator from the"
510,"The stay was very comfortable, with great facilities.  It was within good walking distance of the museums, and easy transportation distance of everything else.  The staff was phenomenal and the historic setting was unique and beautiful."
511,"I’ve been a Hilton Honors Member for over a decade. My experience at this hotel has me speechless. My team visited Chicago for NBA Allstar Weekend. We had 3 Suites. I don’t like to complain, so I won’t get into details but Hilton failed miserably on this experience for my team. I will never stay at this hotel again and for the amount of money we spent on rooms, there is absolutely no excuse for the service we received. I highly recommend you save your money and stay somewhere else in the City. We ended up leaving the Hilton Chicago and checking into LondonHouse.  To finish on a positive: Dean & Sandra in Hilton Grand Vacations are phenomenal. Carsarra at the front desk was an angel and needs to be moved up into a Management Role. She gets it!   I would highly recommend Hilton"
512,It was a great location for us and the room was clean and quiet.  The food from the grille was good.  Very easy to get a cab. Concierge was helpful.  We only stayed one night but it was very comfortable.
513,"I stayed here as part of a conference. I found the staff at breakfast and reception to be friendly, but this property lacks many amenities that you might find at other 3-4 star hotels. Housekeeping was not great. They left trash and used towels in the room. They also did not refill empty kleenex boxes. Moreover, the lighting in the room was terrible. There were 2 lamps that made the room dark most of the day. Lastly, the food options were not good. The grab and go place did not have many options for vegeterians beyond over-priced yogurt. I also found the continental breakfast to be lacking. The pasteries tasted stale, I saw orange juice come out of paper cartons, and the fruit didn't taste fresh. I think this hotel has potential to be nicer. I am assuming that Hilton is more"
514,"I just stayed for five nights at the Hilton Chicago for a conference and had several problems while there. The housekeeping was poor - papers under desks and the bathroom vanity, an old sock left in the closet. One day, housekeeping never showed up at all. I had a significant problem with temperature control. If i had the heat on, it was too hot and uncontrollable. If I turned it off, the room became too cold.   The breakfast is decent, but overpriced. One morning, the server tried to charge me for a full breakfast when all I had was a continental one. Another morning, a female colleague was treating me to breakfast. The male server, assuming I was paying, gave the check to me. When my colleague took it, he commented that as the man, I should be paying. Not only was this"
515,Executive suite is adequate;  but not amazing in size.  The beds were very comfortable. There are 2 bathrooms; which helps out.  There seems to be a staffing problem.  We are Hilton Honors members and they always only had one person at checkout.  Room for 5 to 9 personnel.   
516,"This is a conference hotel that can't keep up with the number of people that stay here. I stayed for 5 days this past week and the carpet outside my room was never vacuumed during my stay. There was litter and dirt that I began to recognize as I came and left my room. On one night my room was not refreshed when I returned at 6pm. The heat in the room was also a problem. It was 77 - 81 degrees even when set to 68. I was told to open the window which wasn't easy. And one last issue, because the hotel is near Grant Park, there aren't a lot of places to eat nearby. This past week it was quite cold so I looked at the offerings in the hotel. The breakfast buffet was $35+ per person. I know hotel food is sold at a premium but this is simply too high. The other options are a faux"
517,"Disappointing experience. Room was clean. But overall hotel was lacking. Quite dated, felt shabby. Checking in felt like being in a train station, with a long line cordoned off by ropes. Color scheme and decor muted and dated. Just didn’t feel like a 4 star hotel at all.  "
518,"We spent one night at the Hilton Chicago in conjunction with an office holiday party that was being held in one of the ballrooms.  Overall, our stay was highly satisfactory, although we had limited exposure to the hotel's amenities.  Check in was crazy mobbed because there were multiple holiday parties at the hotel that night (Saturday about 10 days before Christmas), with many attendees staying over.  As a Hilton Honors member,  however, we were able to avoid the long line by using the electronic check-in feature.  We were upgraded to a one-bedroom King Suite on one of the upper floors, facing Grant Park and the Lakefront.  Amazing views and a spacious room.  You could hold easily have a party for 20 people in the living room. The furnishings were rather dated, however,"
519,Beautiful...fast check in...fast checkout. Comfortable beds. Super clean. Easy to locate.  Con:Expensive parking charges...we did UBER...LOL 10 minutes parking @ doorman post. Historical property. Bellman...Consciere Service...Doorman...come dressed to impress.
520,I have been a HHonors member for almost a decade and never have I been treated as if I am so unwelcome and unwanted by anyone the way I was from the moment I arrived. I planned a getaway to Chicago for my birthday on 2/11 because I wanted to have a calm and relaxed moment. I thought this hotel would be the perfect place. I could not have been more wrong. It started from the moment I went to check in and the young lady that I dealt with was rude and didn’t even greet me with so much as a hello. I had wanted to check in online so that I could choose a high floor room but was having issues with the app so I asked her if I could change the room from the 8th floor to something higher so I could maximize the Lake view that I had purchased. She looked at me and rolled her eyes and
521,It was a very nice hotel excellently remodeled with a modern style.The room was spacious clean and very comfortable. They have a fully equipped gym and a full sized lap pool that are of the best quality I've seen in a hotel in many years. The staff are excellent and super friendly. The only thing missing is free internet and smart TVs.
522,"This was my first time staying at this property and I really enjoyed myself.  The view, the food and the service were all  amazing!!  My room was exceptional.  This place is a whole city within itself.  Downtown Chicago is great."
523,Each staff member treated us all with respect and kindness. The follow up texts to make sure all was well was most welcome! Very grateful for this staff. The hotel itself is GORGEOUS!!! I cannot wait for our conference here again next year.
524,"I love being a Hilton Honors member because they always make me feel like royalty. We only stayed one night, but had the best time. Since we were able to extend our check out to 2pm, it felt longer. Also, after checkout we used the indoor pool, whirlpool, and sauna! Special thanks to the Customer Service Coordinator, Robert Almaraz who had a bottle of wine waiting for us in our room. The turn down service is a great service to offer as well. I also want to give a shout out to Amanda at the front desk as well as Tiffany and Alicia who texted me just to make sure I had everything I needed. I plan on coming back  soon! Thank you all!"
525,"Checking in took about 10 minutes . Process was a little longer with employee than normal . Nice facility, great location for walking to shopping, restaurants, and parks.  Security in hotel was available. Grab and go restaurant was convenient with good choices . "
526,"This hotel is a Chicago icon. It lives up to its badge. We were given a large room with a lounge (upgraded at no cost on 4 July). The hotel has large halls and lobbies, despite its size lifts worked well and promptly. The rooms were very comfy. Wifi had a good speed. The toilettes were adequate. It was great to have a small kitchen. Location was perfect to explore Chicago, you could walk almost anywhere and if not a short Uber ride away would get you anywhere in no time.  The check in was smooth, and the service was impersonal but efficient. It was my 2nd stay in this property (the first one had been 20 years ago) and I can say the hotel retained its charm and lives up to expectations.  I would highly recommend it."
527,"We had a great time at the Swedish Covenant Gala in October of 2019. Everything was great from the reception through the end of our stay. We enjoyed the food, the ballroom,  our hotel room was great and so was Kitty O""Sheas. I also appreciated the fact that the hotel checked for our room key when we headed to our room by the elevators.  I like the extra security for guests. We will definitely stay here again.  Great time."
528," Top location at the city, an typical USA big city hotel a lot of tradition long corridors nice rooms and somewhat unmotivated staff, but I can recommend everyone for a weekend trip. Location, location and location!!!"
529,"Feb 2 to 4, I was at this hotel. not my choice, my employer booked me at this hotel. Everything was fine until I showered , when I noticed dark black stains on the bathtub near the corner on both sides. At first I thought it was just a stain. But then I started sneezing, and later after the shower , I realized it was molds, only because I have experienced such in my rented apartment. I also noticed fresh caulking between the bathtub and the wall. It sure covered most of what was mold because only a small portion of the mold area was showing. I then was smelling a moldy odor. I then called the operator to report the problem. I was passed on another person, who just said, ' ok , we will look into it. after about an hour or so, some maintenance guy, inspected the molds, a said' oh"
530,"Frankly, at some point it feels like a ""tourist trap"" you expect from shady hotels that only disclose true benefits of your stay once you are already booked. For this hotel type some things should not even be an issue as they are easentially ""a given"". For example, you dont have an access to the gym as a customer and have to pay extra. You also get water in your room only on the 1st day. Breakfast is not included. Yes, it is clean, great location, and staff is frindly, but isn't this what you expect from this type of hotel anyways, especially for the price. That being said, we stayed only half of the planned stay and moved to Hyat as all those amenities above are included in the price, and yes, it is clean and staff is also friendly."
531,"Lots of History here. It's in a great location overall. Been here before. I like it...I only get high floor rooms, so I don't really no what the other ones look like. Great full breakfast buffet......"
532,I love older hotels and the Hilton Chicago is one of the best. Lots of dark wood and marble with high ceilings and ornate trim. The public areas of the hotel are beautiful. Guest rooms are very nice and well done as well. I have been to this hotel several times for business meetings which included use of the Grand Ballrooom. If you stay here try to see the Grand Ballroom and also walk around the other public areas. Well worth the time. In a city noted for great architecture this hotel fits in very well. Great location on Michigan Avenue across from the park and Lake Michigan waterfront.
533,Patthamon greeted me and made me Feel right at home from the time I arrived. I appreciated that she checked on me each day and took care of my late check out. She represented my favorite hotel very well. Thank you Patthamon
534,I can't say there was anything wrong about the hotel.  It is a old hotel but nothing was great either.  The restaurant was just ok.  I had an issue with something flashing in the middle of the night in the room and had to change rooms.  Could not figure out what it was.  The staff wasn't rude but wasn't pleasant either.   Nothing horrible.  The hotel is just ok. 
535,Overall I love the Hilton chain. I always stay at this particular Hilton every time I am in Chicago.My room was perfectly located. I had an awesome view of the water and overall downtown. Doy Gildart was a great help! I never buy these vacation packages and he old it to me without being overwhelming! Easy to talk to and got the job done fast. I cannot wait until my  trip to Vegas.
536,I received a free room upgrade to the 16th floor which had an amazing view. Thank you to the staff for making my stay most pleasurable! This is where I will choose to stay whenever I'm in the Chicago area. Thank you Hilton!!
537,"Absolutely the worst Hilton we have been to. The Executive rooms are a joke, as is the breakfast add-on.  This executive room literally faced another building, had nothing extra in the room, and was dark with an odor. Front desk employees are unfriendly and have a racist demeanor. You are better off at Embassy Suites."
538,"After driving all night, I SPENT MY TIME CALLING TO ASK ABOUT AVAILABILITY AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH CHECK IN so we could be aware in our choice of where to stay. We were told we could not make reservations over the phone which began my frustration, as I had a credit card ready and wanted to be able to check in and go to sleep. That not being an option, the lazy man answering the phones late at night ensured me to just come in and it wouldn't take long. It did. Unfortunately, we wasted the Chicago leg of our family vacation on this suspiciously inexpensive Hilton. I should have known if its too good to be true it probably is. We only stayed as a ""day guest"". Meaning we arrived exhausted at 5am and planned to leave within 6 hours. We paid $50+ tax for TWELVE HOURS IN THIS HOTEL."
539,Rooms were very good. Staff was friendly. Easy check in/out. Location was amazing and it was easy to get from place to place and see landmarks. Meeting rooms were very large and able to accommodate a very large group.
540,Doy made sure I was taken care of and was great with offering recommendations for other Hilton hotels.Thank you for your hospitality. You are awesome! I also enjoyed my stay here at the hotel. Very clean and the gym is amazing.
541,Upon traveling for business to Chicago from Ohio I met two lovely Hilton employees. Doyle and Sandra we're so pleasant and welcoming. I've been a diamond member for over eight years and this is a large reason why I only travel Hilton!!  I was offered a package through Grand Vacations buy both of them and I'm so excited for my next travel experience with Hilton!
542,Room was immaculate. Park on site was handy. Options for food were good. The little cafe/shop had Starbucks and many other breakfast items to eat there or to go. Staff everywhere to help get you where you needed to go. Love the adult hot tub plus family hot tub. 
543,"The check-in process was pretty smooth and they even upgraded my room! The view from my room was fantastic, the bed was comfortable, and they had a good selection of restaurants in the hotel! I would definitely return to this hotel again if in the area!"
544,"This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. We much enjoyed the large pool, sauna and gigantic fitness center with indoor running track. Yaasmeen at the front desk was in particular helpful and truly made our stay very much enjoyable, she went above and beyond on several requests. Good beds, historic halls and ballroom and good food make this hotel a gem. Of note: it is close to the Field museum and Shedd Aquarium and a (roughly) 20-30 min walk will get you to the loop. "
545,"Gorgeous views, big rooms, and quiet (away from the sirens that plague many downtown Chicago hotels). My top recommendation for a reasonably priced, elegant stay in Chicago (and I've stayed all over downtown). Plus it was super cold out and the room was nice and warm. "
546,Stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving.  The lobby is amazing!  We booked a room with two bathrooms.  It was a nice touched but they were very small with little room for storage.  Rooms look very dated and could use some updating.  Our rate included breakfast and parking. Parking was very easy.  The breakfast was very good.  Housekeeping left a lot to be desired.  There were literally towels and garbage cans left out in the hallway throughout our stay.
547,"This hotel is just average. Don’t be fooled by the history and impressive lobby. This is not a five star hotel. The rooms are old and a bit shabby. There is a shower with a shower curtain, no mini bar, no complimentary water, no in room safe. The room service starts from 5:30 so if you are travelling from abroad and wake up early because of jet lag prepare to starve and be thirsty.   Also check that your room is clean. Mine wasn’t and I had to call to get someone clean it. The service works: I did get  the room cleaned and some water from the front desk. But it is very average. They don’t help you with your luggage. They also take a fee from taking care of your bags if you want to leave them after you’ve checked out. I have never experienced that before even in a two star hotel!"
548,"This Hotel holds great history and you can sense it as soon as you walk through the front door.  The Hotel is in great shape and has been updated to current accommodations that you expect in a new Hotel.  Other than the Restaurant being closed during my stay, it was Wonderful.  Kitty O'Sheas is great and they have a first class Gym/Fitness Center.  I highly recommend this Hotel.  "
549,"This is a busy property located within a 15-20 minute walk to the museum campus (Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, and Adler Planetarium) and a short walk to Millennium Park.  The rooms were well appointed.  Our party of 7 stayed in 2 different 2 Queen Bed, 2 bathroom room.  This type of room is a major advantage of this hotel.  The Diamond member benefit was a $20 voucher per night per room for breakfast at the coffee shop.  I was under the impression it was a credit at this restaurant, but there are apparently restrictions on how the credit can be used.  No upgrade was offered for the room and we were put on a normal floor.  A bit of a disappointment for the Diamond status.  Overall, it was a comfortable stay."
550,Stacy and Marvin helped us keep our 3 Giordano's pizza's frozen we had promised to bring home for our family.  They were so helpful and accommodating to us.  We will be sure to stay here on our next visit to Chicago.
551,"Jessica our tour guide was absolutely wonderful. She kept the tour interesting, personal-able, and super informative. My husband was the one who wanted to see the tour and I thought it might be a bit dry but since it’s only 30 min. I figured I’d why not.  I was very pleasantly surprised. So much wonderful history that I’m ashamed to admit that I am just now learning it after staying here many times over the past tens years. Thank you Jessica and I think we were with her even longer because we had questions, hence the 30 mins flew by. Jessica’s enthusiasm, adoration, pride and respect for the hotel and its past and present guests made me want to not only stay here again and again but work here too! The tour is  beautifully presented and I will be recommending this to friends and"
552,"So while this hotel had lots of interesting history, beautiful brass details throughout the hotel including the doors & elevators, it’s historical value and beauty did not meet up to its image. First of all I’d like to say what I felt was positive about my stay here, which is the only reason I’m giving it two stars. The people at  front desk staff, Herb cafe & Kitty Oshea’s had a group of wonderful friendly & helpful staff. The room was clean. This was by far the only positive experiences I had here.   The rooms were nothing special.Average size with  peeling paint in the ceiling , it had an odd layout with the desk being in a narrow area behind the bed & was difficult to walk through. The central heat would not shut off no matter how far you turned down the thermostat. "
553,"Doy was excellent today!! He immediately came over and asked us what our needs were and if there was any way that he could help. He was very kind and patient with us and was able to book us an amazing deal. Thanks Doy, keep up the great work!!!"
554,"I was traveling alone with my three kids in Chicago. I arrived at the Hilton and everyone was so helpful. The guy holding the door, the lady who checked me in was patient with me with the kids, and one guy in particular, named Doy, was super helpful. Not only did he answer my questions about the surrounding area, but he was very polite while selling me a vacation package. Normally people selling vacation packages are annoying, but he was so good, I decided to buy it. Also, I want to add the cookie decorating made my kids travel so much better. Thanks Hilton!"
555,Family staycation at the Hilton during winter break is always a blast!! We love swimming at the pool. Relax in the hot tub. We can have dinner on the premises if we really want to relax or the kids love Bub City so if we feel like venturing out that’s our go to spot!!
556,"We stayed for a family weekend.  The rate drew us in.  Our room was plain, bathroom old, pool had literally wall to wall kids and parents - we turned and left to avoid the insanity.  Wait for elevators was forever...  Might have been the weekend... Still fans of Hilton, just not this one."
557,"My husband and I stayed here when attending a seminar.    The staff providing us with outstanding customer service from the moment I made my reservation through my entire stay.    It's a beautiful hotel with a comfortable sitting area downstairs.  The room we had was outstanding, with an amazing beautiful view of the lake.     We were very happy with everything."
558,"We took my grandson on a train trip to Chicago and stayed at the Chicago Hilton, we had a wonderful time and love the Hilton hotel. It was very reasonable and central located. The staff were very friendly and the hotel very clean, I would highly recommend staying here if you are in the Chicago area for any reason "
559,"This is my 3rd year in a row staying here and this hotel never disappoints.  I upgraded to a lake view and it was well worth it!  I would recommend checking the NFL schedule before arriving as there could be a lot of fans there on home weekends (Soldier's Field is a short walk).  However, even with the fans, everything was great.  One small gripe - I didn't get any water bottles on my stay. But I obviously lived to tell about it."
560,"We've had really good luck with this hotel and have been back a few times when visiting downtown Chicago.   This hotel is nice for couples or families. We love the extra room, clean accommodations, nice pool, and hot breakfast. The room is spacious with a separate living room and kitchenette. Beds are comfy. Bathrooms are clean. The pool area is nice with a gorgeous view of downtown.   We definitely recommend a stay here if you want to be close to everything downtown."
561,"Plus:  super location, 2 short blocks from red line metro, easy access to mag mile and downtown.  Corner suite with second window wall really opened up the room.  They will hold bags for your last day.  Pleasant staff.  Late check out no problem.  Kitchen.  Comfortable bed.  Minus:  there are no extras at this time - not even the breakfast sandwich you got in early covid - nothing.  Kitchen has neither d/w soap nor even paper towels (!)  You get plates and glasses.  But at least a f/s fridge (with one (!) ice tray).  No housekeeping.  Yes, there will be disruptive people in the street lobby who don't belong there.  Horribly uncomfortable sofa.  Place is mainly a value for convenient location - plan on using super easy CTA, parking is like $60 a night."
562,"Zero attention paid the shady people that hang right at the front door of the hotel. Was there for 7 nights and had at least 3 instances where homeless people were actually inside the hotel panhandling people at the 1st floor elevator. Zero security presence, a desk that could be used as either secuirty or a valet sits unmanned 24 hrs a day at the 1st floor elevator approach. Meanwhile the lobby is on the 6th floor. Once inside the hotel is great! l just really think its poor service and unsafe to maintain no control over the front entrance and elevator approach. The neighborhood degenerates are all very familiar with the easy pickings and lack of security in this front entrance area. We actually saw a security guard from the business right on the corner shoo a few homeless"
563,"My job booked a room for me here due to the protests to ensure I could make it to work, and when they told me which hotel, I was like "" meh, whatever, it's free"", but BOY WAS I WRONG about my expectations! The front office manager on duty (Asian gentleman, didn't get his name) was very welcoming and me, working in hospitality as well ( my hotel is closed temporarily due to corona)I can appreciate and recognize great, GENUINE service. When I got to the room, it was so nice, and SPACIOUS! MUCH nicer than some rooms I've stayed in at ""4 star boutique hotels"", I loved the kitchenette, the bathroom was big, everything was beyond what I thought I'd get. And the bed.. That bed. Wow. I slept like A BABY! Can't wait to stay here again really soon! You guys rock!"
564,"We did not get to experience the full hotel since the lobby and restaurants were closed due to the pandemic. The layout of the one bedroom suite was excellent and the sofa bed was useful. Great location, loved having Starbucks across the street. The room was quieter than I expected it to be based on previous reviews. The only thing keeping me from a 5 bubble/5 star review is that the room seemed somewhat dingy and the bedding didn't fit the bed great, but it was fine. The most positive part of the stay was the pleasant staff who handled everything very nicely during the pandemic. All of the staff should be commended for their efforts, thank you and stay safe!"
565,"Came into the city to celebrate granddaughter birthday. Decided to spend night. Location was great. Room was very clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly. Jeremy was very helpful and pleasant! Pool area was clean and had nice view on 19th floor. Breakfast was standard and ok. Evening social was a little disappointing compare to other hotel we have stayed, but was still ok. We drove in and used the valet parking, attendant was not very helpful or friendly. Would definitely stay here again, if back in the city. "
566,Have stayed here couple of times before - last trip 2018.  Room was clean with everything you want supplied - great view of the Wrigley Building (see pic).  Breakfast buffet supplied all you needed.  Evening food provided (I was there Wednesday & Thursday nights) was great with everything being replenished as it was running low. I didnt have to wait for elevators at all (receiption in on 6th floor with rooms starting above which give great views over the city).  Good wifi and hot water in shower/bath had good pressure.  Bed was comfortable and AC works will in the room. Will happily stay again when am back in Chicago.
567,"This was our second time staying at this hotel. The stay itself was not bad, room was relatively cleaner as compared to the last time. They charged my card separately for parking even though I had paid for park and stay package when I made online reservation. After four or five phone calls to the hotel and an email to Hilton corporate office I was able to get the refund. They gave me the reason that there was some glitch in their system.  "
568,Great option for a solo traveler. The pool on the 19th floor made for a great  morning swim with a wonderful view. Breakfast was always good but the waffles were not offered on Saturday morning. I enjoyed my stay and the kitchen staff were always very welcoming.
569,"I feel that I may be somewhat biased in this review since I booked this hotel during the low season on a Wednesday night, therefore got an amazing deal online.  I didn't even realize this was going to be a suite with a full kitchen until I opened the door - so just in that regards this room surpassed my expectations.  Regardless of the price, even if I had to spend quite a bit more, I think this place would have been worth it.  It really does feel like a home away from home, with the room giving a small apartment vibe.  I was able to get groceries and cook myself a small dinner - pots/pans/utensils and various kitchen utensils were all provided.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a decent free breakfast in the morning (which I didn't even realize was included as well).    Most"
570,Nice clean place to stay. The view of Chicago from upper levels and pool was beautiful. The suites were very nice. Kitchen clean and cute. The beds were nice and comfortable. And it was close to alot of eatery's and markets.
571,"I stayed here for 2 nights on a work related trip.  The first floor concierge area was great for the Uber pickups.  The lobby itself is on the 6th floor which is also where the free breakfast is located.  There is a free happy hour with dinner each night. Breakfast was ok. I don't eat eggs but a friend said they were kind of rubbery.  Also she got what she thought was decaf coffee one morning and then had the jitters all day so - maybe control your own coffee destiny LOL.  The room wasn't huge but was very nice.  There was no fan in the bathroom so if you have to have that door shut when you shower, expect it to be steamy in there.  The water pressure was on the weak side but not enough to bother me.  The bed was firm enough and there were both foam and feather pillows on it"
572,"Booked two nights here in a king one-bedroom suite. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful to me. The valet person on the ground floor was always pleasant and it was nice to know that there was a staff member at the entrance for safety.  The room was fairly spacious for two people and the kitchen was very nice to have. Some of the glasses were dirty with food stuck to them, but it was good that I checked before using them. There was also several scraps of paper on the bathroom floor behind the door that were still there when I checked out, which means housekeeping did not sweep the bathroom floor after our first night, although they did replace our towels for us as we expected them to.  The evening social was very nice to have available. I went to it my first night"
573,  We got a very good deal during the 7 Feb weekend. This is very nice hotel (3/4 star). It is not a hotel room but a 1BHK apartment with full kitchen inside. View from the room was perfect (trump tower and downtown).Service was good. Room and linen were clean. We enjoyed our stay. Breakfast had so many options from hashbrown to eggs to walnut etc.
574,"We live in Michigan and have been making trips into Chicago for the weekend for decades. We’ve stayed in a lot of different hotels, but none of them have been as convenient a location as this Homewood Suites. You can, quite honestly, easily walk to just about any major attraction or restaurant in the city. It’s ridiculously close to the Magnificent Mile and all it has to offer. Depending how fast you walk, about a 15 minute walk to the lakeshore. And tons of restaurants abound in the area, from dressy and expensive to mid-range and business casual to casual family-oriented places (Rainforest Cafe, Hard Rock, etc.).  The breakfast buffet was great compared to other breakfast offerings I’ve seen at other mid-range hotels. There was always a scrambled egg and cheese option, a"
575,"Large suite rooms. Full kitchens, lots of electrical outlets, strong wifi signal, evening social with real food. Beds are comfortable. Located near a city mall with lots of restaurants and food options nearby. "
576,"Great location with a comfortable room and the evening social was a nice addition. The room was clean with nice spaces. The space for the breakfast and social was terrific. The quality of the food was not superb for all parts..maybe a bit better quality coffee or wine available would be nice. It was very convenient in it's location and the staff were polite, friendly and professional."
577,This hotel is located within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. The rooms are so spacious we were able to hold committee meetings in them. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast and evening food offerings are good.
578,"Comfortable living from home with welcoming, attentative, and helpful staff.  Nicely sized rooms, breakfast, workout space and pool. Only two elevators -- so if you're visiting at a busy time there's a bit of wait.I find the kitchen table a great place to work before or after meetings. "
579,"Location is great for Michigan Ave and is near the river so you could also walk to Millennium Park.  Every staff member was incredibly helpful and sweet -- from doorman to front desk to breakfast attendant.  The city views from this hotel are amazing -- from breakfast/reception area to the pool to the rooms.  We stayed on the 19th floor which was down the hall from the pool and we loved the peaceful vibe of the pool and again -- that view!  The breakfast bar is a cut above others and the Monday-Thursday manager's reception includes free wine and basically dinner.  When you consider all this free food, the hotel is an amazing bargain!  Also, checking your bags for early arrival or late departure is very easy.  The set-up with kitchen and bedroom is great.  Love everything about"
580,Great place.  Very well located in Chicago spacious room  and good breakfast.    I would definitely stay at this hotel next time in Chicago.     Service was very good   Two blocks away from Michigan av  The gym is not as good as I expected.   Could be better
581,"Everything was good, I  would definitely recommend it. Good room quality, nice staff, great pool with really warm water. Breakfast and evening social were great, the food was tasty. The only annoying thing  is the mandatory 200 characters review obligation. "
582,"I've stayed at this hotel at least twice on my routine trips to Chicago, and I can't say enough great things about it! On our recent stay, we had a very early flight arrival. I called to inquire about leaving our bags with the valet so we could enjoy the city until our room was ready. We arrived at the hotel around 9am, and they actually let me check into my room! No extra charge, no hassle. The guest services agent was extremely friendly and accommodating. (If management is reading this, the associate was working 7-3 / AM shift on Friday, 1/24). There were 2 agents at the desk, but unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the person that checked us in. The other agent was also allowing a guest to check in early due to the same situation, so both get 5 stars! Please be sure"
583,"This hotel is a a GREAT location. Very centrally located. The rooms are comfy and of good size. Mattress was a bit hard for our liking, but might be good for others. There were a few parties we could hear but considering the room stayed pretty quite."
584,"The location was excellent, right next to Eataly. Lots of great restaurants and shopping in walking distance. Staff were friendly. Complete hot breakfast and an evening meal with beer and wine are provided. Full kitchen and large room."
585,We checked in to the 17th floor for a 6 night stay.  The hotel and room was very clean.  Check- in was friendly and fast.  The front doors off the street need some lubrication and service. On occasion a doorman would open.   The room was nice. Beds were comfortable.   Simple and minimally furnished.  The kitchen was a very nice feature but could have used some more cookware and utensils. Housekeeping cleaned everyday including the dishes.  The bathroom needed a little repair as the ceiling Sheetrocker/ spackle was damaged. Also the towel rack kept falling off the wall each time a towel was placed on.   The gym is small but functional. Free weights up to 50’s.  The pool was warm and well maintained. The view from the pool level (19th floor) is great.   Breakfast was good and
586,"We checked in around 4pm, got ready and left for dinner. It wasn’t t until we returned from dinner and started fixing the sofa bed into a bed for the kids when we noticed large dried blood on the side of the sofa, we then looked over the sofa linens we just put on the sofa bed and realized theres dried blood on the sofa blanket. How disgusting!!!! I immediately contacted the front desk and someone came up and offered to move us to another room. All the kids wanted to do was go swim. However, we repacked and move to another room. I asked the hotel worker what will be done to compensate for the inconvenience and disgusting bodily fluids left in the contact of my 2 young children. She said some snacks, I explained we just ate and have snacks. She then said she will see what could"
587,"I can’t say enough about this hotel. Clean, comfortable rooms, in the heart of downtown Chicago (close to Michigan Ave, Eataly, great restaurants) for a very reasonable price. My family also appreciated the free happy hour (beer, wine and light dinner) and breakfast. The staff was exceptional and extremely accommodating.   "
588,"Excellent location, staff is over the top friendly.  I will book my next stay in Chicago at the Hilton Homewood Suites.  The rooms are great, very clean.  They do allow pets, which is great.  I am looking forward to my next trip to Chicago (next time leisure trip)."
589,I would definitely book this hotel again. I love the social from 5-7pm and the complimentary breakfast. I had a room with a city view and I loved it. My bed was very comfortable and I love that the kitchen in my room had all the utensils I needed if I wanted to cook.
590,"Family gathering in Downtown Chicago with our family from Spain.  We enjoyed the location and its proximity to a market, Michigan Ave. Shopping, and even Navy Pier.  It is a well kept property with great service, including a meal or two on the weekdays."
591,"I will start with the good, the breakfast and evening social during the week were fantastic and the breakfast/evening social staff were extremely friendly and helpful.   The bad was both rooms we had contained multiple issues with the bathroom and windows. The tubs in both rooms were cracking badly. The second room we had the shower drain was so slow it covered your feet. Our toilet sounded like the little engine that could every time you flushed. Our window would not close for two days.  We encountered attitude when we tried to get a new room and still had problems with the second room. They did address the issues when we checked out but room issues caused the stay to not be as enjoyable as it could have been."
592,"Overall location and cleanliness of the room was good. We have stayed at many different hotels in the are. We like this one the best as the proximity to shopping, eating and night life was the best. We would definately stay at this hotel again"
593,"Very close to many tourist sites, restaurants and shops. Also was very convenient to my work as well as train stops making it easy to get around. Parking is expensive, so being near the train makes traveling to and from the airport was cheap and easy. "
594,"I would recommend this hotel for its location, price, and overall quality.  The location is fantastic, just off Michigan Avenue.  The breakfast was good, the staff was excellent, and the rooms were spacious.  On the downside, the elevators were always crowded, the rooms are a little dated, and the hotel was a bit cramped."
595,Was a great experience and friendly staff. Clean rooms. Will recommend and be back for the future. Cleanliness was great. Great location for walking distance and very convenient for everything  Rate a excellent  trip
596,"Only 2 elevators, slow and packed.  Rooms were hot, thermo didn’t work. Beds were uncomfortable. Sheets felt they were made of plastic and fitted sheet kept popping off.  More attention to detail while cleaning needed, in rooms and hallways, pool etc. happy hours were great!   Variety each night and beer/wine.  Breakfast was mostly the same each day and not very impressive.  I would stay again just bc of location, happy hour and price.  Just be ready to take stairs.  "
597,"We picked this location based on its location and the size of the room which was actually a suite. The suite was larger than our first apartment! The kitchen area had a big refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and cooktop. There is plenty of room to store luggage and shopping bags. We used valet parking which was fast and attentive. We found it strange that when we walked in the only thing in the lobby was the valet attendant, you have to go up to the 6th floor to check in. This hotel is within easy walking distance of shopping and dining. The pool area has a great view."
598,"Our kids want to move out of our house and into the suite. Homewood Suites has spoiled us. We can't stay in a normal room now. And we can't book a suite with any other chain because they are too expensive. So you really have no other options, just Homewood Suites."
599,"This is the second year in a row that I´ve stayed there. The attention of bellboy and reception is just ok. Although the servers and kitchen people, very good. Mostly what I like is how close it is from everything, easy to walk to a lot of places and the rooms are very comfortable."
600,"I surprised my 6-year-old daughter with an overnight stay in downtown Chicago. She loved the city views, cracking the window open and hearing the city sounds and most of all, the indoor rooftop pool. The breakfast was far better than most hotel continental breakfasts and the staff was fantastic. The pool was a bit crowded and chilly, but we still enjoyed it. The location was amazing. The red line train is very close, it was fun to walk to the nearby shops and I saved a great deal of money on parking by using the SpotHero app instead of using the hotel's valet service. It's walking distance to Rainforest Cafe, which was a hit with my daughter. The room was very clean and the price I paid was a great value for the area. I highly recommend this hotel and will keep it in mind for my"
601,This hotel is relaxing and has great amenities! Staff is very nice and helpful. The free dinner socials and breakfasts are some of the best complimentary meals we have had!! Definitely worth the stay!
602,"Spent 2 nights here for business (Monday and Tuesday nights) and was very happy with the stay. Check-in a breeze, lobby beautiful and just sorry I had to leave too early for breakfast and did not get to experience the snacks from 5-7pm. Room clean, comfortable, great view, quiet, good temperature. Nice to have a big fridge, and the table was good for using my laptop, plus there were many outlets for charging all my devices. I will definitely be back."
603,We had 3 reservations for 3 rooms. We travel with grandkids and when they get up they come in our room so they don't wake up the others. Must have rooms together. Called 3 times and still were not together when we checked in. Said there wasn't anything they could do. Never again.
604,Great hotel at an amazing location in downtown. Rooms come in studio apartment-style and offer a nice value for money. The room came with free breakfast which was good. It will definitely be my first choice to stay in Chicago.
605,"A very nice choice if you want to be as close to the Magnificent Mile as to the best restaurants, department stores and the Red Line that will take you to any sport stadium in town. Nice suites with full kitchen, king size bed, gym and pool available on the top floor and excellent breakfast and managers reception at the end of the work day. Friendly and helpful staff adds to the nice experience. Highly recommended!"
606,"We had pleasant stay. Location was good, loved the complementary breakfast. Especially this location loved it more. Their Thanksgiving dinner was AWESOME.  it was very homely and Serving staff were amazing. We had a bit of problem on the black Friday in suite service. Otherwise overall very nice experience for me and my family"
607,"Lots of fun in Chicago!  The staff was great. We arrived before check in from the train, we dropped off our bags and checked in.  We were happy to find that a room was available. Unfortunately it looked as though it hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned. Housekeeping eventually took care of it, and the rest of the stay was great. Great location, great breakfast and evening social was a pleasant surprise. Also, Having kitchen to use helped so much! "
608,"The staff was amazing and the view was incredible. However the room was furnished with cheap furniture that went way below the standards of the Hilton Hotels. Bed was hard and uncomfortable, the couch was a pull out and the cushions were so thin you could feel the springs and the temperature you couldn’t control no matter what you did..up or down with the temp and nothing happens either it was too cold or too hot."
609,"Our family was lodging at Homewood Suites Chicago Grand Ave last weekend and found this facility a great find. For the price of the stay, we found the breakfasts provided to be over our expectations. Jeremy, the breakfast porter made our stay very pleasant and treated us like family. The location on Grand Avenue was great as it was centrally located to the shopping on Michigan Ave as well as convenient access to the Chicago mass transit system.  One thing we value is the way the staff treats their guests. Concierge Sammy was particularly friendly and helpful for what we needed. An added perk to this facility was the small kitchen facilities that we used to make sure our grandchildren had their snacks and eats. If I could give this a 6-star rating, I definitely would."
610,"The hotel was amazingly located, the room were very clean and spacious, the staff was friendly and always willing to help.  the only recommendation would be to offer soft boiled eggs, or freshly fried eggs."
611,"Rooms have plenty of room to spread out, and full kitchen accommodations add to the allure.  The staff was exceptional friendly and made sure all needs were met. Breakfast and night social hour included.  Highly recommend this location.  "
612,"As an annual visitor to Chicago to watch the Bears (who by the way are just so bad!!), could be off visiting the awesome city of Chicago. This is my 3rd visit to Homewood suites within the last year, they have never disappointed. On this particular visit i had the studio suite, it was perfect. Complimentary breakfast is really good, the staff on front desk are always so helpful. Better yet its next door to my favourite steak restaurant Joe’s. Not the even the visit of Trump on his first visit to Chicago since he took office when I was there, would put me off returning to East Grand Hilton."
613,"Close to many fun restaurants and things to do. Rooms clean and nice but bedsheets are stiff and rough to sleep on. Complimentary breakfast was ok, not great options for anyone with food allergies though. "
614,"Had a quick one night stay over in Chicago. This is my third trip that I have stayed at this location and always enjoy myself. Only downfall is the elevators are a bit slow, but the staff more than make up for it. Staff in the Evening Social and Breakfast area are amazing, always look forward to speaking with them. The food selection is always great as well."
615,"This was the first time we visited Chicago and we know and trust Hilton suites when we are new to a place.  The hotel ticked all the boxes, had spacious rooms with a decent size kitchen/utilities so we did a fair bit of shopping at the local Jewel Osco (my daughter loved the little shopper trolleys, why doesnt everyone do them).  Rooms were fitted out to a high standard and i suspect the carpets were brand new due to the amount of static shocks we were getting everytime we touched each other or door handles - zap.  Breakfast was one of the best ive had in a long time, the choice and quality superb.  As others have mentioned location was great and we managed to fit in a visit to Billy Goat Tavern which was just up the road!"
616,"I highly recommend Homewood Suites, it's just north of the Loop, a block from Michigan Avenue and perfectly located for easy access to shopping, dining, and all of Chicago's great attractions. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable, with plenty of space. The views are great as well! "
617,"Excellent location.  A short walk to Michigan Avenue,  Millennium Park,  Navy Pier.  Great restaurant's all around.  Friendly and helpful staff. If you're looking to stay in downtown Chicago, give Homewood Suites a call. "
618,Excelent hotel for the price and centrally located in Chicago. very close to public transportation if you did not want to rent a car.  Hotel staff was very freindly and accomodating and rooms were very  clean and comfortable.
619,"We had a very nice experience at this hotel. We have 6 in our family, and we fit comfortably in the suite. There is a nice kitchenette if you want to eat in. The staff was very friendly, even the bell guys at the front door. They offer a free hot breakfast in the morning, which was nice, so we didn't have to worry about eating out for breakfast. Location is great, and right in the middle of everything.  About a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier. We would definitely stay here again!"
620,"The hotel location is great but I was told due to their online pricing policy, the hotel sells out and they WALK customers to another hotel.  When I got there they said oops we sold out and have to put you in a room next to a family (noisy kids) and zero upgrades and the breakfast area was PACKED with people (had to go eat outside the hotel) and the food was really cheap and reheated from a packet, bag or box.  Not a good hotel, just a good location.  Sad :-("
621,"I recently stayed 5 nights at this property while attending a convention in Chicago.  The downtown location is near many restaurants, the river, and the Magnificent Mile.  It offers the standard Homewood rooms, which appear to have been recently renovated.  Mine was very clean and well maintained.  Be prepared for quite a bit of noise from the street....sirens through most of the night.  The inside of the hotel is quiet.  The included breakfast was pretty good, probably better than average for Homewood.  My only complaint was that the bananas were over-ripe to the point of being mush.  There's a small gym on the 19th floor.  The equipment is OK but the TV on the elliptical didn't work (a common problem).  Regardless of a couple of small problems, I'd certainly go back."
622,"Very pleased with the cleanliness and the location of this hotel! Will definitely stay again! Also, it is right around the corner from Eataly, one of the best places to eat and grab an excellent cup of coffee! "
623,"I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Downtown Chicago and really enjoyed my stay.  The entrance could be a bit tough to find as it is only marked my a street level double door and and awning. You actually take the elevator up to the 6th floor to check in.    Every member of the staff was very friendly, from the valets, to the front desk to the people who served breakfast.  The hot breakfast was very good and varied everyday. There is even an evening cocktail hour with free wine, beer and tea or coffee. The offer a light meal as well that was unexpected and tasty.   The only reason not to give this hotel a 5 star rating is the room is rather plain. I liked it, and it met my needs, but nothing lavish. But it was clean which i prefer. I also had a great view of the"
624,"Spent another birthday at this location based on my pleasant and previous satisfactory stay.  Reserved a Two Queen Beds One Bedroom Suite which was spacious.  However, the living area sofa pillows were flat and uncomfortable and it was difficult to stand after sitting because the sofa is so low.  The furniture could use a serious update (Room 1108) because it is so beaten down.   Betcha carpeting would be brighter and fresher if shampooed.  Bathroom area is very large and  blah with a too low toilet seat.   Location is great and Happy Hour is ""Happy"", due to the gentleman named ""Jeremy"".  Food was also good, plentiful and filling.   Beds are comfortable and a door separates bedroom and living area.  Full sized refrigerator was a plus, worked well to chill our snacks, drinks.  "
625,"Stayed for five nights while husband attended conference. Close to restaurants, stores and riverside. Arrived late and after check in the assigned room had a view of the parking garage.  Called to front desk and spoke with Mel who had checked us in and was super friendly and welcoming. After explaining I would be spending time in room she was able to reassign to upper floor room with a great view of the city and even came up to room and escorted us to our new home away from home. Made the overall experience exceptional.  Only drawback was included breakfast was not friendly for diet."
626,"My stay was very pleasant, the staff was helpful and polite, my room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is located close to fabulous restaurants that are within walking distance. I recommend this hotel for anyone visiting this area of Chicago. "
627,"This hotel is very convenient to the Red Line L Train stop Grand/State. Very friendly staff, great breakfast and a 24 hour coffee station with  good coffee creamer. You can take the Orange line L train from Midway and switch to the Red Line at Roosevelt to Grand/ State for $3.00. "
628,"The Homewood Suites is conveniently located in the River North area, across from Nordstrom and the attached shopping complex. The service is excellent, from sales, to front desk, to valet, to housekeeping, to the attendants at breakfast and happy hour."
629,"Location: perfect Service: perfect Beds: king size too soft and sofa bed not comfortable (sorry but it was awful) Breakfast: wow!!!! Super good Staff: super friendly Rooms: great views, complete and equiped kitchen, king size bed, black-out windows, dining table, modern, great!! Pool: warm and with a 19th floor view!  Would definitely stay there again!!!"
630,"Other than the location, I would not recommend staying here.  The A/C is our room was noisy (but rarely produced cool air) and the beds were very uncomfortable.  Broken doors, broken toilet, incredibly slow elevators - the list goes on.  "
631,"We stayed here for 8 nights. The room had a large bed with dressing area, wardrobe, bathroom, lounge, kitchen and dining table. Very well placed hotel. Hotel is very clean and all the staff we met were very pleasant.  Breakfast is excellent and Monday to Thursday evenings they have an evening meal with wine or draught beer which you help yourself to. Food was great. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. "
632,"We arrived to a warm welcome from Erin at reception.  She was really helpful.  Our suite was very clean and spacious.  Breakfast was very nice.  The evening social between 17.00 and 19.00 was a very nice addition.  Nice snack food , wine and beer. Really recommend this hotel. It's also a great location,  u can walk to Bavy pier and river walk fairly close by"
633,"Really enjoyed our stay. We arrived to a very warm welcome from Erin, who was amazing.  Our suite was fab and really spacious.  The view from our window was fab,  trump tower and wriggle buildings. Beautiful at nite. The breakfast was very tasty and the social nights Monday to Thursday were at great addition and surprise, tasty snacks , wine and beer, free from 17.00 to 19.00 "
634,"This is our 4th trip to Chicago and first one not in the loop. I like the location of this hotel. Lots of restaurants and a short walk to Michigan Ave and 1 block to the red line. Room is clean and reasonably fresh. For a suite, it’s small, but plenty for two. A family of 4 would be tight. Main drawback for me was no safe in the room. In a large city that would seem to be a basic requirement. Wound up having to carry my backpack with laptops all weekend. Wouldn’t stay here again due to that. Breakfast area was bright and well maintained. Food was ok. There was a young man there who provided excellent service with a great attitude. Should have gotten his name."
635,We checked in to the 17th floor for a 6 night stay.  The hotel and room was very clean.  Check- in was friendly and fast.  The front doors off the street need some lubrication and service. On occasion a doorman would open.   The room was nice. Beds were comfortable.   Simple and minimally furnished.  The kitchen was a very nice feature but could have used some more cookware and utensils. Housekeeping cleaned everyday including the dishes.  The bathroom needed a little repair as the ceiling Sheetrocker/ spackle was damaged. Also the towel rack kept falling off the wall each time a towel was placed on.   The gym is small but functional. Free weights up to 50’s.  The pool was warm and well maintained. The view from the pool level (19th floor) is great.   Breakfast was good and
636,"We checked in around 4pm, got ready and left for dinner. It wasn’t t until we returned from dinner and started fixing the sofa bed into a bed for the kids when we noticed large dried blood on the side of the sofa, we then looked over the sofa linens we just put on the sofa bed and realized theres dried blood on the sofa blanket. How disgusting!!!! I immediately contacted the front desk and someone came up and offered to move us to another room. All the kids wanted to do was go swim. However, we repacked and move to another room. I asked the hotel worker what will be done to compensate for the inconvenience and disgusting bodily fluids left in the contact of my 2 young children. She said some snacks, I explained we just ate and have snacks. She then said she will see what could"
637,"I can’t say enough about this hotel. Clean, comfortable rooms, in the heart of downtown Chicago (close to Michigan Ave, Eataly, great restaurants) for a very reasonable price. My family also appreciated the free happy hour (beer, wine and light dinner) and breakfast. The staff was exceptional and extremely accommodating.   "
638,"Excellent location, staff is over the top friendly.  I will book my next stay in Chicago at the Hilton Homewood Suites.  The rooms are great, very clean.  They do allow pets, which is great.  I am looking forward to my next trip to Chicago (next time leisure trip)."
639,I would definitely book this hotel again. I love the social from 5-7pm and the complimentary breakfast. I had a room with a city view and I loved it. My bed was very comfortable and I love that the kitchen in my room had all the utensils I needed if I wanted to cook.
640,"We booked a night here following our wedding reception and everything was lovely. I did not realize it at the time of check in but when I had mentioned that we were getting married, the person at the check in desk upgraded us to a suite! Absolutely did not expect that, and it made preparing for the wedding much easier. "
641,"The staff, hotel and rooms are BY FAR superior to any we’ve stated at in the area! The Executive King Suite made it possible to put our 2 year old to sleep in the bedroom easily with the sound machine and doors that shut. My husband was able to get up early to work without waking our son. The suite is HUGE with special features like motion lights under the nightstands that light up at night when you get up to use the restroom. The staff has been extremely caring and remembered our family from our visit last month and ensured we had a quiet room because they knew my son had a hospital stay. If I had a suggestion it would be to put in a bigger fridge and add a microwave to the room. The room is huge and could easily accommodate some other appliances that would help with extended"
642,"Hotel location is very good , animations and overall service was great , room was clean , but the hotel was kind of not occupied because of Pandamic For COVID 19 , but the hotel precautions was really good "
643,"The check in staff were friendly, the room comfortable. We did have issues with breakfast service (so slow) but the food selection was very good. The location is right in the middle of everything so would recommend."
644,"Very nice hotel and in great location with friendly and helpful staffs and amazing service!!  Upgraded to a suite with gorgeous views and enjoyed bottles of wine and rosé sent up to our suite. Enjoyed going to the jacuzzi - relax our bodies from walking miles and miles.  Ate only once at Level Two Restaurant and it was great! - tasty and delicious food. Came a couple times for drinks though, everytime we go out to do sightseeing and coming back- bartender’s so friendly and makes really good cocktails.  We’re definitely going to stay here again if we ever go back to Chicago.  "
645,City view room on 16th floor was beautiful. We enjoyed the room and location. Hotel traffic was low due to Covid and it gave us a chance to experience the peace and beauty of the hotel. The staff was helpful and pleasant. The Starbucks is also right there in the lobby. The only thing missing (a small miss) is a microwave.
646,"Spent three nights (family trip -- taking son back to college).  While the hotel feels fairly dead (restaurant/bar shut, which is different from when we were here at the start of COVID procedures when they were doing ""pick up bagged meals""), things worked really well.  The hot tub and pool were open for single-group-at-a-time usage (reservations on the hour for a 50-minute block followed by sanitizing) -- we enjoyed that every day (not hard to find an open time).  No maid service in-stay, but easy to get towels, toiletries, or whatever from the front desk.  Staff friendly, COVID taken seriously, and a very good location."
647,"I arrived in for the first in  Chicago and It was then I was informed that my reservation at THE TALBOTT HOTEL was cancelled by mistake my them, the told me  could not accommodate me because they were already book and had no intention of honoring the reservation. This was my first time in Chicago and can you imagine not knowing where you are going to stay at 9:30 pm at night?   I contacted the HYATT reservations and they were able to get us,  a last minute reservation at HYATT Centric Magnificent Mile. From the moment I was put in contact with the Manager Adam, it was an exceptional service during my entire stay. Though understandably limited on staff due to COVID-19 restrictions, they did not miss a beat on any request or assisting with any questions or concerns. They were"
648,"We were here the night before a procedure at Northwestern. We had a corner king room and it was lovely. Great bed, nice bathroom, good A/C. We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay! Thank you for making an unpleasant trip better :) We will definitely be back as this hotel is a great location for a staycation  trip too! "
649,"We had a great trip, liked this hotel a lot. All of the employees were great except out first encounter with the front desk. We booked 2 queens and when we showed up at 10 pm they did not have the room type we reserved they could give us a king with a roll away or we could leave. The clerk was very rude about it. Finally a nice lady came over and was very apologetic, bought us breakfast and guaranteed the correct room for the rest of our stay. When we got our roll away housekeeping delivered it to the hall and left."
650,The Hyatt Centric is a really nice hotel and the location is so convenient to Northwestern Hospital.  I had an extended stay here while a family member was hospitalized.  The staff at the Centric were very helpful and always kind.  The Centric is also a short walk to Magnificent Mile.  So may shops and great restaurants nearby.  I will definitely stay here again...hopefully for fun next time! 
651,"We spent four nights here to celebrate my birthday.   The hotel is very nice, the room was comfortable and quiet, and the restaurant was great.   All the employees were very friendly and helpful.   I highly recommend reserving a room with breakfast for two included--it is a great bargain.   The hotel is within walking distance of many places you might want to use--a Walgreeens is right across the street in the Northwestern University Hosptial Building,  a Starbucks is located in the same building as the hotel, and there are several excellent restaurants close by."
652,"I have stayed at the Hyatt on St. Claire in Chicago a couple of times now and have enjoyed my stay very much.  The staff is wonderful, the hotel is in a prime location in the city tucked a block off Michigan Ave. so pretty quiet and still centrally located to shopping and dining, etc... The rooms are comfortable and equal in value to the price.  Will stay again and again when I visit Chicago."
653,"Really enjoyed the hotel. We spent only one night, but the hotel was over my expectations. Everything was high end and conforfotable. The hotel.is very well located, central Magnificent Mile with a lot of restaurants, stores around. It was a great experience."
654,Bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. Ear plugs in the room since you’re next to a hospital. Hotel food wayyyy over priced. The only plus is the Starbucks downstairs. I would not stay here again!!!! 
655,"The hubby and I stayed here from 12/31/19 to 1/2/2020. We booked this hotel very early on, knowing that ourselves and friends would be attending the Resolution Gala at Navy Pier for New Year's Eve. We all managed to get hotels in walking distance from one another, but our friends and family were very jealous of our room. Our room was the meet up point, before heading it. We stayed in a very nice suite, and our room, plus the hotel itself  was very nice. A lot of things were in walking distance, like restaurants,  and stores, which made things very easy, because traffic was crazy those days. The price rate was great considering the time of year, and everything that was going in the city that day. My only issue with this hotel was that it was a lot going on when we came back on"
656,"This hotel was in a great location, right near shopping and plenty of restaurants. A pool, fitness center, bar/restaurant were all on site. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant but did enjoy a drink. The pool and hot tub were clean, and I really like  the fitness facility (they had great treadmills). The room was cozy, just what we needed. The room had a sound machine, which was great. I dislike the Keurig coffee machine in the room, I prefer a good old fashion coffee machine, but that's just my preference.  I booked through Expedia and booked a package with parking included, it was a great deal. Definitely look into this if you will be traveling by car. "
657,Our soaps were used in the shower which made us wonder if our room was clean. My $22 salad had wilted lettuce and the $27 breakfast buffet had only one broken toaster available.  Parking was overpriced at $72 per night. 
658,"I was in town for a wedding and this was one of the hotels where they were holding rooms for wedding guests.   I picked this one because of it's location.  It's right near the Magnificent Mile, great for shopping, walking, food and entertainment.   Upon arrival, everyone was very friendly.  I especially liked that I could check in online and they let me know when my room was ready, earlier than the 3 p.m. check-in. Nice lobby, clean and open, plenty of places to sit and bar.   Room was clean and comfortable.  Had many extras, hairdryer, make-up mirror, iron, ironing board, safe in closest, coffee machine, robe, etc. I was able to check out online and grabbed a bite at their restaurant before leaving hotel.  Hotel prices but had a very good veggie omelette with toast and potatoes"
659,"Stayed here while visiting family. Beautiful hotel and great staff. Just one block off Michigan Ave, a nice 15 minute walk to Navy Pier. Nice bar and lobby with a Starbucks attached. If visiting anyone at or leaving near Northwestern Medical center this is the place to stay. Rooms are large clean and Modern. Staff is helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."
660,The room I was in had very little heat and it was 13 degrees out. The towels are rough. Someone stole something from the bathroom that I had left on the sink. It wasn't very expensive but still... Otherwise the hotel is in a great part of town and walking distance to where I had to go. 
661,"The Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile is one of the finest hotels in the heart of downtown Chicago.  The location is exceptional and is within steps of the Magnificent Mile.  For those who are not familiar with downtown Chicago, take it from a veteran Chicago travel expert, the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile will not disappoint on any level.  Moreover, if you're a clean freak, like me, you will surely appreciate the well appointed and impeccably spotless guest rooms.  Treat yourself to an Executive Suite...But...if you'd like to keep things simple, the basic guest rooms are roomy and extremely comfortable too!"
662,"Check-in starts at 3PM. We checked in early via our phone, noting we would be there at 3:30PM.  We arrived at 3:30PM and were told our room would be ready in a few minutes.  45 minutes later...  No communication regarding the delay.  No compensation offered.  A drink ticket would have been a nice gesture.    Our room was directly across from the ER entrance and we heard ambulances every 10-15 minutes throughout the night.  There are earplugs available at the front desk.   The pool room was nice for families but do not plan a romantic trip here. The hot tub is close to the pool which makes for getting splashed in the face while you are soaking.  "
663,I had several medical exams ay Northwestern Medical Facilities. The location of the Hyatt was idea for this and several other visits.Aaron and the Manager Patrick were great but was was the entire staff. This was my second visit. I will definitely stay at the hotel on future visits.
664,"Nice hotel - friendly helpful staff and clean.  View of downtown from our room was awesome.  We drove so parking was expensive, but not unexpected.  Check in and out was a breeze and the sights of Chicago are within walking distance."
665,Everyone was very accommodating and nice!  Very friendly service the whole week I was there!  Thank you for making me feel at home when I was there!  I'm definitely going to stay here if I ever go back to Chicago :)
666,If getting a suite with sofa bed.  Don’t.  Sofa bed exceptionally uncomfortable.  Hotel did not offer any practical solutions as we were traveling with kids.  Location depends on where you get the room. Emergency room of the hospital is just in front of the hotel. 
667,Staff was absolutely amazing the GM should be proud. They truly demonstrate what Hyatt hospitality is all about! If you have an event Ruben and Angelica* will definitely take care of your group. I am on Keto and they catered to my dieting needs very well. Service is Above and beyond!!!
668,"Nice hotel, very friendly and offered good service! Great location - conveniently located close to shopping and restaurants.  Also, Walking distance to many places you may want to visit - museums, art galleries, etc.    "
669,Location is great for heading out to Michigan Avenue. Valet Parking is very expensive onsite but alternative lots are within walking distance will save at least $50 to $75 for a two night stay. I would plan on venturing out for dining as well. 
670,"I am going on my 21st hotel in Chicago since Jan 3rd and decided to add the World of Hyatt to my list. The 2 nights prior to arriving to this hotel I stayed at Hyatt Regency on Wacker. Great experience so I thought I'd try Hyatt Centric. Well.... the idea was there. Unfortunately. it has left me very frustrated and overall to be a let down. The location is great. Views are mostly blocked by surrounding buildings and Northwestern Hospital is next door (be aware there will be frequent sirens) both of which didn't phase me as a night shift nurse. The rooms are also really great. Aside from the walls being paper thin and hearing your neighbors (1st night-couple fighting on valentines day, 2nd night-screaming children until about 9), I can't complain about room.   The Service on the"

672,"It is located directly across street from Galtor Pavillion & next to Lavin Pavillion. Only about a block or so away from Shirley Ryan. I highly reccomend it for the location when you have a full schedule of doc apts. They do have a hot tub & pool, fitness center. Lobby is located on 2nd floor. The staff was very accommodating!   My doctors needed me in for an MRI last minute apt. After speaking with the awesome staff they made it possible for me to make it to my MRI and not worry about hurrying back to checkout. It all worked out well. In fact I was so happy with my experience I booked my next stay with them. You can't beat the location when you need breaks in between apts I was able to go back an take a nap/rest instead of waiting at hospital for next apt. Had plenty of time to"
673,"I was in town for business but would definitely come back to this location for a pleasure trip. The location is great, a few blocks from shopping, walk/run trails, restaurants and transportation. Great staff too."
674,"January in Chicago isn’t exactly high time for travelers, and the price fairly reflected that. This is a very nice hotel for a great price. I mean, we’re talking $100 or just a bit less, and I felt like I was getting 4 star services. The room is clean and comfortable. A walk in shower, and large bathroom. They also had a white noise machine in the room, which I appreciated more than anything I have EVER found in a hotel room (no joke). I use one at home and usually don’t have room to pack one on the road, so to find that noise maker in my room pretty much sold me on this hotel for every downtown stay I have in the future. Sometimes it’s the smallest of things that make the difference. "
675,Hotel rooms were clean and had just about everything you need. Wish it had a microwave but other that good. Bathroom was large and came with good soaps and shampoo. We were on the 14th floor so noise was minimum. 
676,It was conveniently located to the Northwestern Hospital allowing me to visit a family member daily.  It assured that I was able to spend quality time with the patient while being cared for at the Hyatt Centric.
677,"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Centric Mag Mile for a business meeting.  What a fantastic hotel in a great location.  The staff couldn't have been more friendly if they tried.  Everyone I came into contact with was incredibly helpful and super friendly.  The hotel itself is beautiful with wonderfully decorated and comfortable rooms.  Room service was prompt, and options are plentiful.  The location of the hotel is great, with several wonderful restaurants within walking distance.  This will be my go-to hotel for Chicago trips in the future!"
678,"Business meetings, room seemed to be newly renovated but in fact it had been a few years. speaks to the level of cleanliness and maintenance the room are held to. Good outlet and charging support at the desk. the night stand could use outlet ports but was able to work around that. Good bar and Starbucks on property.  "
679,I brought my family to this hotel to stay the night after several activities with the kids and the experience was wonderful.  The room was clean and the pool was great too!  We'd definitely stay here again in the future!
680,"We really enjoyed the Hyatt.  Our room on the 9th floor was quiet and had all the amenities we would expect.  Even a white noise machine which was a fantastic bonus we hadn't counted on but were glad to have.  The elevator situation is a little odd seeing as how you must take an elevator from the street level to the lobby (2nd floor) and then walk to a second bank of elevators just to access rooms.  Not super inconvenient, just odd.  Overall, we had a great stay."
681,"As expected, I had a great stay with the Hyatt. The hotel is near a hotel so the ambulance siren may disturb some but the hotel does provide a white noise machine in the rooms. I was exhausted at night so slept straight through and was never disturbed by the sirens. It's also in a great location and I felt that I received value for the money I spent. "
682,Loved the location of the hotel. We were right off the magnificent mile and close proximity to all our favorite restaurants! The staff was very friendly and the rooms were very clean! Only negative was the couch mattress. 
683,"Hotel walking distance to a lot of tourist sites. My go to hotel when staying in Chicago. Clean rooms, service was good. Great buffet! upgraded to bigger room no extra charge. world Hyatt member. very cheap hotel. "
684,Clean hotel. Room was great. Customer service was excellent and sent text messages checking in. Sent additional towels and sheets within minutes of requesting. Check out was easy (in app). Starbucks in hotel lobby was super convenient. 
685,I stayed here for a conference for two nights. Room was ready early on check in day. The breakfast was outstanding. Clean and comfortable room.Helpful staff. I would definitely return to this location. Easy walk to area restaurants and shops. 
686,"All the staff I interacted with were incredibly friendly and helpful, service was always prompt and professional, location was great with plenty of good dining and interesting sites nearby, and rooms were clean, comfortable, and spacious!"
687,"We stayed at the Hyatt Centric Mag Mile for my weekend birthday celebration in the city. The staff at the hotel made our stay effortless and truly special. I appreciate the thoughtful attention to detail at this great find in the heart of the Chicago’s Magnificent Mile. You can be at the center of the action of the city but feel a world away at the Hyatt Centric because the lobby is located off the street level.   The modern décor and attention to detail is what really made this hotel stand apart for us. Our room pampered us with unexpected comforts including: a white noise machine to block out the city sounds at night, motion-activated floor lights that guide you to the bathroom in the dark, DryBar hair dryer, smart televisions, great-sounding wireless speaker system to listen"
688,"Looking for a quality stay for a decent price? Look no further - the staff is welcoming and accomodating, you are close by so many things and restaurants. Next to a hospital and being in a city will make for some noise but the complimentary sound machine and ear plugs can help."
689,"The very Best in town. The price is very good and correct. Location, space, building, rooms, quiet, quality, service, people, cleaness, comfort, bed, bath, so everything really really awesome. Enjoy every moment and every single day in my stay. A beautiful place to stay and visit. Im glad to return ASAP."
690,Large well maintained rooms with thoughtful touches throughout and was also a great price in January. Bar was lively (and had charging points at the bar :). Good WiFi and beds also.  Didn't use the pool/gym but heard they were good. The Beatrix cafe across the road has much better coffee than the awful Starbucks in the foyer. Lots of great food and shopping options in every direction. Would stay again.
691,"Oveall property was clean and amenities were fair. Good location and friendly hotel staff. Marking down due to poor FNB service personnel, general unattentiveness. While my stay was short, I enjoyed the polite service from the desk from check-in until check-out."
692,"We stayed at the Hyatt Centric Magnifecent Mile, and the staff was very kind and helpful. The room was great, the view was perfect and the bed was lovely. The only downside was that the hotel does not recycle. "
693,"Hotel exceeded expectations. Highly recommend.Rooms, business center, and food excellent. Loved the Starbucks in the hotel. Bed very comfortable and excellent location for meetings at Northwestern and ShirleyRyan Ability Lab."
694,"Didn't know what to expect. Beyond my expectations. Food was great. Convenience awesome. Clean, comfortable... great staff! Highly recommend this property. Starbucks in the street level was really convenient. Pool and exercise facilities were good enough for a city trip. Overall a relaxing and peaceful trip."
695,"The Hyatt centric magnificent mile in Chicago is by far the best Hyatt hotel in downtown Chicago. Except for the night audit that works overnight at the hotel, her name is Kimberly she is very rude and I wish no one experience what I experience. If you are checking in, look for Debbie the front desk supervisor she will take great care of you!! "
696,"Very nice room, not overly elegant but clean and functional.  Great location.   Excellent service from everyone from checking to checkout.   Not too keen on the second floor lobby and having to change elevators every time.   "
697,"I would like to extend and express our true appreciation and say thank you to all for the incredible, wonderful and excellent customer service provided by each and everyone of your staff during our stay. We were treated like family. Thank you."
698,The hotel staff were absolutely incredible and welcoming. The decor was top notch. The rooms were what we expected. They even upgraded us to the top floor; free of charge. We will definitely come back to stay. 
699,The staff are exceptional. I will stay here every time I visit the Magnificent Mile. I was given great service and really enjoyed my stay here. Everything in the room worked as it should. The hotel is ideally located and secure. It is just an overall great choice. 
700,"I stayed in this hotel with my 3 daughters over the New Year's holiday.  We couldn't be happier with our choice.  The location is excellent, just a short walk to Michigan Ave.  Our room was clean and had a modern decor.  The staff was very friendly.  We did not eat in the restaurant/bar but there was always a crowd there and the atmosphere seemed very inviting.  The pool/hot tub area was crowded but thankfully my girls are old enough that not being able to get in the hot tub was not a huge disappointment.  For as reasonable as the room rates were, I was in no way expecting the level of quality and service we received!  We already want to make this an annual tradition."
701,"This has become my go to hotel when im in Chicago for business. It's a block off Michigan ave. Which means its just enough out of the traffic and chaos of Chicago but still close enough to everything where a Uber ride to the Loop or Lincoln Park is only minutes.   The hotel its self is a pretty standard Hyatt Centric. Friendly staff, definitely leans heavily on the business travelers. Tourists seem to stay more on Michigan ave. Rooms are very clean and updated. Starbucks in the lobby, a little secret, if you dont want to wait in the line which is huge on mornings. Go right next door to Do-Right for Coffee.   The Level Two bar is one of my favorites. It has great views of the city and has a very relaxed atmosphere. Cocktails, wine and beer are typical prices for Chicago. The"
702,"Every detail in the room was exceptional, even the ice bucket design, were top notch! Motion sensing nightlights at the foot of the bedside stands were awesome. Staff were so very professional and welcoming. The buffet and late checkout package are a MUST! Daily buffet was incredible and like we were dining at a 5-star restaurant. The silverware practically sparkled! I plan to go back for another getaway."
703,Starbucks is in the building. It is a few blocks from everything. One block from 7-11. The room is clean and the service is excellent. It may be the most spacious hotel room I see in Chicago. I visit Chicago more than a few times a year. This hotel is my favorite! 
704,"Rate including parking: cannot complain! Literally steps from Mag Mile. Modern room, comfortable beds & bathroom with counter that actually fit toiletries for hubby, myself & teenage daughter. Friendly employees. "
705,"The location of this hotel COULD NOT be better. It was one block off the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave) which means hardly any traffic just outside, super easy and convenient to pull up for valet parking, AND still crazy convenient to all the sites and attractions on the Magnificent Mile (less than 400 ft from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery, in case anyone is curious!). We drove into Chicago from out of state and had no issues getting to/from the hotel. Valet parking is $70/night and you have 24 hour access to your vehicle, which is great. Staff was all very friendly and helpful, the building was clean, modern, cozy and luxurious all at once. We felt very safe (there's a night doorman and you must use a room key to get on the elevator). Bonus, there's a Starbucks in the same"
706,"1. Nobody helped us with our luggage or even offered a luggage cart when we first arrived at the hotel. 2. The food at the hotel restaurant was awful (it used to be good). 3. Room service did not bring us a table because there were only two of us. The employee who delivered the meals said this was hotel policy because they have so many rooms and argued with us. We had to insist on a table since there was no other surface in the room to put our plates, cups and glasses and be able to sit down for our meal. 4. The keycard readers in the elevators did not always work."
707,"Everything was Great!! Nice and friendly Staff. The room was beautiful, the bed was very comfortable. The Food was delicious and it is just an overall good looking hotel. I will defiantly stay here again. And I highly recommend this hotel to others. "
708,"Great hotel, staff, and location. Was greeted and treated great by all hotel staff. Had a wonderful corner room. Was an added bonus with Starbucks located as you entered the hotel. East check in and checkout"
709,"The coffee machine in our room was filthy, so I asked the concierge if my fiance and I could get complimentary coffee. This person said, ""I can't do that"" and told me to go to Starbucks! Then he told me to pay $30 (per person) for the breakfast buffet. I said that's ridiculous... imo we paid for 4 nights and breakfast shld be free!"
710,"This was a Christmas 2019 trip to Chicago staying on a package booked through Expedia. We upgraded to a standard king corner room for a small fee. Well worth it as this provided lots of storage and space for the 6 night stay.   Starbucks on the ground floor was friendly and useful. You need to make your way up to the 2nd floor lobby to check in. Staff was friendly and check in simple. Check out the Windy City display on your left as you enter the lift to your room. 7th floor for us. The room was lovely, clean and spacious. A good view of a bustling Chicago out of the window. Big bathroom, powerful shower over bath and two sinks with all the amenities you may need including a powerful hair dryer, flannels, cotton buds, shower gel, shampoo, body lotion, fluffy towels and bath"
711,The location of this hotel was great. The room was nice but I don't think I would have paid the hotel rate for it though. I am glad that Expedia had a special. We were in the largest suite but there weren't really any additional perks to reserving such a large room.
712,"Awesome in every aspect. Location was fantastic to get to all the places in Chicago. Staff were wonderful and helpful always willing to help out. Restaurant service and food amazing. Plenty of nice places to eat nearby, very close to main strip but you seem to avoid the congestion and noise from it which is a good thing."
713,"This Starbucks has the same great drinks and food I’ve come to expect from Starbucks. The baristas are friendly, and the location is perfect when visiting Northwestern Hospital - right across the street. "
714,"This was our first stay at this location.  I liked how close it was to Michigan Avenue and located right in the middle of the magnificent mile.  It was 1 block back, so it afforded a bit more privacy and quiet.  Great restaurants right around the area as well.  We will return!"
715,The room was comfortable and had everything we needed.  The view was beautiful and we loved the location for shopping and museum hopping. The continental breakfast buffet in the onsite restaurant was convenient and delicious.   I'll stay again.
716,Everything was perfect. Hotel staff was very helpful and did everything more than expected. Cant as for more than what we experienced. Welcome center also gave us a free starbucks gift cards as a welcome note. We tried that in the Roastery chicago.
717,"My whole family came to Chicago and rented 5 rooms at the Hyatt Centrc Magnificent Mile hotel just before Christmas for 3 days/2 nights.. We had the best stay ever! Fabulous location just a block off Michigan Ave, lots of restaurants nearby. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and modern, rooms beautiful and the mattresses are the best! Staff was very helpful and accommodating of all of our requests. The food in the lounge is great. the grandkids enjoyed the pool and adults the fitness room. We will be returning again!"
718,"We had a great stay at the Hyatt Centric.  1 block from the new Starbucks Reserve (which is fantastic!) and close to everything on Michigan Ave.  Took the train in and a quick Uber to the hotel.   Room was clean, staff incredibly friendly and welcoming.  "
719,"Hyatt Centric is centrally located, just off the Msg Mile. The lounge is cozy. This Hyatt is nice because it is just off the Mag Mile, so it doesn't feel as congested, & it's quieter. There's also a ton of great restaurants & bars within a few blocks."
720,"This hotel is exquisite! Friendly staff, very comfortable, and right in the heart of great restaurant and shopping. Even if you are not a big swimmer be sure to check out the pool, it’s stunning with lots of architectural details. "
721,"Loved the hotel and the service! We came for a weekend getaway trip due to the pandemic eating away at our mental health, and we felt super safe coming here. The front desk workers were super helpful and amazing, and everything was set up so well around the pandemic. Everything was sanitized and clean, and we barely had any contact with guests or workers. "
722,Spent one night here pre-Covid and was very impressed. Clean spacious room up to InterContinental standards. I’m a Spire Ambassador so quite happy with the upgrade. Huge bathroom with powerful shower.   Breakfast downstairs was also excellent and was of high quality. Always thankful for my 4pm check outs as I had a 7pm flight to London. I will definitely stay here again.
723,"The Intercontinental is typically a very nice hotel. However, I have to rate this location a 3 because of the awful stench that hit us upon entry. It smelled like very rotten meat or a dead body in the lobby. I’m not exaggerating. When we asked an employee about the smell, he pretended he didn’t smell anything. The smell was in the lobby, only, thank God. The rooms were nice. We had a view of Lake Michigan from our room so that was a plus. After complaining about the smell the next day, it was finally gone the following morning.  "
724,"Given that I was one of arguably 10 guests in the entire hotel, I cant say I was surprised at how barren the place was. Even the main lobby restrooms were locked. In fact, minus the lobby, starbucks, and the elevators, nothing was open. While the staff were nice, I had a major problem with the couch in my room and the downstairs staff just took it as a nonchalant comment. I was there for several hearings and actually needed the suite living room for work. When my clients pointed out the dirty couch, it was too late to rectify with the staff. Color me surprised that post hoc nothing was done too. The rest of the room was excellent and the internet speeds were the fastest I've ever seen in a hotel, bar none."
725,"The location, room, and staff were outstanding.  From check in to check out the staff was attentive, responsive and gracious. The location was central to museums, shopping, dining, and parks. We look forward to our return visit. "
726,"In these strange times, the staff was incredibly professional and friendly.   Safety was clearly a priority.    This hotel has one of the most exceptional indoor pools I have used.  The details from 1929 are so pretty.    Wholeheartedly recommend.  "
727,"We always love this hotel. The pool is really beautiful and the service is great. They even graciously moved us to a different room (we wanted more windows). The bathroom needed a little TLC, but overall, the hotel and rooms are very clean. Will be staying here again!"
728,This place never disappoints. We love staying here and being well serviced by the hotel and restaurant staff. It’s got a great location for shopping and most everywhere you would want to eat is just a short ride away.
729,"If you follow our blog RetiredAndTravelling dot com you will fully understand why this property is OUTSTANDING. The  Outstanding Management ensured we were treated like family. Communications with the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile IHG property started before we even got there. Ronald Hoogerbrugge, the Hotel Manager ensured our stay was flawless. He showed outstanding customer service attention when he gave us a tour of this wonderfully historic hotel property.  Outstanding Staff like Mikena, the front desk supervisor answered any problems with great solutions. Douglas provided excellent concierge advice & service.  Ambassador check-in with M was great. Billy curb side convinced us to valet park at hotel - very pleasant and good brand ambassador. Sylvia, a concierge"
730,"There was only one person (I believe his name is Gustavo) behind the counter in the lobby.  He was very professional and an excellent representative of IHG. Due to COVID most of the usual activity is gone for now.  However, the hotel is still my favorite in Chicago. "
731,"On a weekend trip to Chicago, we chose to stay at the IHG hotel. The location was perfect, InterContinental is right in the center of it all. The service, and the view of the iconic Tribune Tower were among my favorite parts. However, the pool is a must see; beautiful! The pool/gym/spa are was very relaxing."
732,"This hotel made the best of a bad situation during COVID. They took great care of me and my family during our 3 night stay. The fitness center, spa and pool were all open ( and fabulous!) during our stay. Even if you aren't a swimmer you owe it to yourself to check out the amazing tile work in the pool area. Great place to relax and read or even check email! We will be back!"
733,"Excellent stay. I have already stayed at the Intercontinental Hotels before in Sydney, Australia.  The same level of professionalism, efficiency exists in all. You have exceeded my expectations. Staff was accessible at all times.I was really impressed on how personable they were despite this pandemic we are facing. "
734,Stayed at this hotel for my sisters birthday and it was amazing! The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. I would stay at this hotel again. We had a total of 3 rooms and the hotel went out of their way to make sure we were all next to each other.
735,"Spacious room, kind staff, and close to everything we wanted to see. We had a noisy family on our hallway, but the staff shushed them quickly. Smart pandemic policies, and good value. We'd stay there again without hesitation."
736,"My family and I stayed for the weekend. The rooms were clean, beds very comfortable and front desk was kind. Unfortunately due to Covid Michael Jordan’s was closed. The hotel was quiet. We did not used the fitness spa or pool, but it looked amazing! "
737,We loved our 3 day stay. The staff was wonderful. We were walking distance to great restaurants and the Magnificent Mile. We would recommend if you want a luxury feeling stay here. Be sure to take the hotel tour. The swimming pool is beautiful and the view from the lounge is just unbelievable. 
738,The Intercontinental is a great hotel--walking into our room we were wowed!! My daughter is pretty quiet but she was so excited about being there. Great experience great staff. Loved the location of the hotel to the Navy Pier and downtown.
739,"We have stayed at this hotel numerous times and it's always great. This last trip was during Covid 19 and even though things were strange in Chicago, the hotel did not disappoint. The staff (especially Malcolm) is exceptional - friendly, helpful and courteous."
740,"There were three of us, so one of the beds was to fit two. When I signed up, the rooms were listed at having two Queens. When I arrived and checked in, I was asked if I wanted one King or two Queens. I chose two Queens again, but when we got to the room they were clearly Fulls. The next day I told the receptionist that we had Fulls not Queens. She insisted that they were Queens and that the hotel had only Queens and Kings, so I went back to the room and checked the mattress tag. Fulls. Next morning when I checked out I mentioned this, and she insisted that the hotel only had Fulls and Kings. The confusion at the desk was annoying, but if we hadn't been told Queens, we wouldn't have chosen Intercontinental. We didn't sleep well.  Rooms were smaller than expected (compared to"
741,Very satisficed. Not many at the hotel. Restaurants and bars were closed. Sad but understandable. The parking is a problem since it is extremely expensive near Michigan Ave. Rates between $40.00 and $ 55.00 for a 24 hours term is next to outrageous. 
742,Have to qualify this review by saying it was newly opened after Covid-19 shutdown so restaurants not open and no room service or maid service but management very accommodating with fresh towels and trash removal and other requests
743,"Me and my wife are bloggers, we stay at a ton of hotels, and this hotel was by fair amazing. My son wanted to stay at a hotel because the stay at home order was getting to him, and he wanted just to relax somewhere other than our own home. So I decided to book a staycation at IC, and let me tell you it was worth it.  When we arrived during the middle of the night we were greeted by an older gentleman, very nice guy. Before I could even finish he had upgraded me and my wife’s room. Excited we rushed and went to the room it was nice didn’t have that “old” smell most people who are doing the reviews stated it smelled wonderful. After sleeping one night in the most comfortable bed I slept in a very long time. I received an email from their Room Controller, Perez to state we had been"
744,"Made a last minute reservation the night before my husband's surgery at Northwestern. Due to coronavirus I could not accompany him to the hospital so I needed a place to stay. My regular hotel was booked but there were many rooms available here. Luckily, because of this, they allowed me to check in about 4 hours early and check out the next day about 5 hours late to accomodate my needs since I had to work around my husband's surgery scheduling. Also I received a very nice room upgrade with a view of the city. Everything about the room was excellent, huge, clean, beautiful, upscale, loved the bathroom. Comfortable bed and pillows, just perfect. The hotel felt nearly empty and the restaurants were not serving. Since the city was pretty much shut down I ordered meals on grubhub and"
745,"Hi....I booked a trip for May 12.  I went to cancel it today because of COVID.  Im a platinum member.  Sometimes you get stupidity from a place and it takes an email or two to get the hotel to understand things and the good ones ""get it"".  This one...despite many back and forths is still standing firm.....because i booked a rate that inclued a first night deposit, they would not refund fully despite the fact that i am cancelling because the event i was attending was cancelled because of COVID.  They offered a credit for a future trip to their hotel but i dont have one planned.  I fully intended to attend but i had no way to predict this would happen.  The IHG policy offers full refund for reservations up till April 30...I am two weeks late so they want to profit off of that. "
746,We decided to take a staycation since spring break was cancelled due to the Covid-19 shut in and chose the hotel as they had a pool so our girls could swim. Once we arrived we were treated amazingly! We booked a regular room and since the hotel was not busy during this time they upgraded us to a “gynormous” suite!! We felt like royalty and it really made the loss of spring break less of a bummer. The staff was wonderful!!
747,"Great location in the middle of Michigan Avenue / Magnificent Mile. We were in the old classic tower. Needed to take a second special elevator to get to room. Very cool recommend accepting if offered. Great views. Relatively quiet - could here sirens but that was about it. Some noise from next door unless we closed closed door. Great 25 yard indoor swimming pool. Room has robe, room safe, iron & board."
748,"Everything was perfect - Thank you! Great check in experience with Daniel, service at the bar was fantastic.Room and views are gorgeous. Concierge service is excellent, Thank you Kathy. In room dining service, delivery and food was great. A wonderful weekend and excellent translation of the InterContinental service, I also had the chance to meet with the Director of Front Office  Cintia Becera who was very welcoming! Thank you very much, looking forward to more visits when this Covid19 is over."
749,"     I think the rooms can be spruced up a bit. The rooms don’t match the name. Otherwise everything is top notch. Great guest services, they welcome and accommodate wonderfully. Prime location, close to EVERYTHING. We were there for our anniversary and they took care of us with complimentary wine and a beautiful card. A very pleasant surprise. We would love to stay there again."
750,We were hosting a meeting at the Intercontinental right when all of the news about Corona came out.  The staff and management of the Intercontinental were so professional and giving during this stressful time for all. 
751,"So clean and well kept with such charm ad all of the staff is wonderful... Our doorman Will was just the best, very knowledgeable knowledgeable and helpful..with wonderful suggestions for newbies to Chicago..."
752,I was looking fir a hotel with a good pool fir an overnight withy granddaughter. The Intercontinental was rated in the top five.  Between the high rating and the competitive rate I chose the Intercontinental. I added the family package for $50 more which paid for itself . The staff was super accommodating for me and my granddaughter and she had the time of her life. I appreciate all  the extras   the hotel did for me and  my granddaughter.  For those who are grandparents you know it’s all ahe grandchildren .   I am booking a stay for May when my daughter can accompany us we are looking forward to our next adventure at the Intercontinental. 
753,"Room was very clean. Cleaning service did a good job.  I liked location the most. Right in a heart of Chicago. I got my breakfast to my room and service was perfect - warm food, everything covered.  Definitely recommend! "
754,"Excellent location, large room, quiet nights, great shower, everything you need in a hotel. Great for business travel, but I will certainly be bringing my family here on my next trip to Chicago. Best thing about this hotel is the staff, nothing was too much trouble, everything is done with a smile. Highly recommended."
755,"Stayed on the 33rd floor in a King Executive room.  Great view of the river and city especially at night.  Very convenient location for shopping, eating and entertainment.  Valet service was prompt and courteous.  Front desk and bell service was outstanding.  "
756,"Dear InterContinentalChicago,  I would like to thank your concierge team Sylvia for making sure my plan where in order for a wonderful night out in town! Thanks for having my stay a memorable stay & a shout out to valet for making sure my transportation need where met!"
757,"We were staying 3 nights with teenagers and had never booked a suite before.  We stayed in one of the amazing suites and it was perfect.  It was like having a spacious living area completely separate from the sleeping area.  Best part, there were 2 bathrooms! I cannot say enough about this hotel and staff.  I do not have a single complaint."
758,"The location is perfect; the Starbucks attached to the hotel is great for interviews. The hotel staff is extraordinarily professional, from the welcoming check-in to the willingness to answer questions to the check-out and the doorman who helps with bags. I really do not consider any other hotel chain."
759,"The Hotel was in a great location with plenty of great shopping ,restaurants and just plain areas to walk to! The staff was very accommodating, service was excellent, rooms were very comfortable, well kept building with many great features! The  attended convenient parking was a nice feature! "
760,We had the pleasure of seeing Dinka our hostess and Yugen our server every morning of our stay. Everything we asked for was provided with prompt service and a smile. Besides the breakfast food being amazing the attention to detail and service is definitely what kept us coming back. Thank you Yugen and Dinka for making our Chicago stay even that more enjoyable.
761,"I’ve stayed at many properties in Chicago and the Intercontinental is my favorite. I like the overall ambience; staff are friendly and helpful; rooms light, comfortable and good size; great location. I enjoy Michael Jordan’s bar and restaurant. Overall, it’s my hotel of choice for Chicago."
762,"Spent four nights here on a business trip and was massively disappointed. Rude, unhelpful staff, old fashioned and dirty rooms, average breakfast. The hotel clearly hasn't been updated since the 80s.  To make matters worse, my colleague found a cochroache in his room. This is totally revolting and unacceptable. See photo"
763,"Have stayed at many nice hotels in Chicago, but put the Intercontinental at the top of the list. The location on the Magnificent Mile is perfect, close to many excellent restaurants, shopping and the major sites. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are very clean. The pool is very nice. Fitness center could use some help. The bed in the room was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. Overall a great stay. Highly recommend. "
764,"Nice older/historic hotel.  The location was perfect.  Check in was a problem but only because we didn't know each person had to be listed on the account to check in and the office manager made the reservations.  Had to call her to get clearance.  (Won't forget that again).  The rooms are nice and clean but on the small side with is normal for an older building.  Biggest complaint is that there is about a 4"" x 6"" space available in the mini fridge for guest use and the rest is stocked with grossly overpriced drinks."
765,We stayed here for all star weekend and the hotel was amazing...room service was pricey but it was well worth it. It was also valentine’s weekend so we had dinner in Michael Jordans restaurant and everything was delicious. Room was very clean and spacious. The location was even better if you like to shop. Everything is walking distance. 
766,"The only good thing this hotel has going for them is the location.... other than that rooms were very small, dated and musty for the Intercontinental Brand. I’m an IHG Plat member and have been to many Intercon hotels around the world... the bran has been starting to go downhill...Parking was also very high. Gym and pool are dated. There are so many nice and updated hotels in the area that I will not be staying at the intercontinental in Chicago again."
767,Excellent hospitality. Clean and fresh. Rooms were small but very adequate.  Lots of hot water in a great tub shower. In the middle of downtown on the miracle mile. Walking is so easy. I must say the weather was warm for Chicago February. I’ll be back thanks hotel staff
768,"We have stayed at many different hotels on the Magnificent Mile and our stay at the InterContinental was a memorable one. If you’re looking for a large pool where the kiddos can swim, this is the place to be. The ornate details in this classic pool are unique and beautiful. The pool is 4 foot deep on the shallow end and goes to 10 feet. This is important to know if you have less experienced swimmers.   The room was nice as well. We stayed in the Executive Tower, which I hear is more up to date with respect to furnishings. The shower is one of the best I’ve had in a hotel. Plenty of hot water and a nice shower head for complete coverage.   The parking is easy to get in and out and the employees were all a pleasure to interact with.   We’ll be staying here again and will try out"
769,"I stayed at this hotel for business. They had to move my rooms three times when I checked in because of the smell of weed and cigarette smoke. I had extremely noisy neighbors, and I called the front desk several times for them to help me, but they never returned my call or followed up. They offered to clear out the mini bar so I could use it to store medication, but they never did, even after calling down 5 different times. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had. I travel 265 days out of the year and I stay at many hotels. I give this rating a huge thumbs down."
770,"Well located property with excellent service and lunch restaurant. Shy away from breakfast: it was ok, with dishes off in flavor( all had same oily taste). Beyond that very nice rooms and easy access to Michigan Avenue."
771,"The price is not bad and the property is very nice. Staff is excellent and accommodating as well. It's really nice having the ENOlogy wine bar and Micheal Jordan's Steakhouse right in the hotel. Otherwise, the location is excellent. I've been coming here for years and it's one of my favorite places to stay..."
772,"The front desk staff was friendly, professional, and accommodating. The room was spacious and had great views. It was a great one night staycation in the city. If there was one downside, it was the price of parking. We ended up parking in a garage next door for a third of the price."
773,Great place to stay. The location was excellent and staff were very nice. Excellent gym. Transportation to and from the hotel from O’Hare was easy as well. Magnificent mile shopping was close by along with multiple great restaurants.
774,Fabulous setting. Easy to reach all areas and ability to do most events without vehicle. Definitely would stay here again. Was fine doing a review until I was required to submit 200 characters to be able to continue
775,"We were there for my birthday and the hotel was beautiful, it was more than I expected. Great place to stay and the employees were very friendly always. My husband wants to go back to Chicago soon!!!! "
776,"This was our first stay at the Intercontinental. The front desk staff was efficient and accommodating, allowing us early check in when we arrived ahead of time (they also permitted late check out for our friends staying there). The room was comfortable. My kids really enjoyed the pool even though the water was cool; and the family movie poolside on Saturday night was a fun bonus. The fitness facilities are very nice with plenty of equipment and space. Would definitely recommend. "
777,Old aged Hotel with with very poor insulated room N#3106. I was feeling the wind and cold from outside trough the windows. I complained they offered me to change room but packing all my stuff for only 1 night no thanks! Instead they offered 31 usd room service charges thanks for that but it will not make me feel better about the overall experience.  Additionally the price of the parking is ridiculously high. 75 usd / night which is 15-20 usd higher than same hotel range in Chicago Dowtown.  Last but not least this room is located not far away from firefighters.   Low value for the price   
778,From the moment we arrived we felt at home. Will greeted us with a smile grabbed our luggage helped us check in. The bellman told us about the room’s features and places to visit near the hotel. Lunch was great at Michael Jordan’s. The Room was very comfortable. The exercise facility was fabulous and the pool was so cool. We had wonderful weekend looking forward to returning 
779,"Excellent service from a valet parking to check-in and thoughout my stay! Staff was polite, efficient and responsive. Had a challenge with a FedEx shipment which was resolved quickly. I will be back to this hotel."
780,"The hospitality from Housekeeping to front desk was over the top.  Had a great stay in Chicago due to this hotel, the views were great, the room was clean and the service was over the top.  Thank you Intercontinental Chicago"
781,"We have visited this hotel in January the last two years and had a great experience both times.  The rooms are nice, the service is great, and you can't beat the location.  We will definitely stay at this property again.  Highly recommend!"
782,Rented 2 rooms - went with a friend and our kids to spend a night in the city and use the pool.  Both at night and the next morning our kids were scooping bugs/cockroaches out of the pool.  When I brought one of the critters to the front desk the woman was disgusted and did nothing about it.
783,"Stayed here for a work event and could not be happier with the accommodations. From the room itself to the conference rooms we used for our event, it was easy to navigate, clean and the staff was super helpful. Will definitely be on my list to revisit next time I'm in Chicago."
784,"The stay was great.  The staff was very responsive, and offered me a new room when I commented on the loudness of the air handling system in my room--at 3:00am!  The bed was very comfortable, and the TV was HUGE!"
785,"We have stayed twice as a staycation- New Year’s Eve & later in January because we enjoy the hotel, location, service, and amenities. As well as the staff being very proactive to see if anything was needed, they also reacted when we needed assistance. Especially on New Year’s Eve when it is crazy busy we appreciated the attention and help. "
786,"The hotel is vast, but that does not take away from the service. Upon check-in, I had a slight issue with my room, and it was handled within minutes. They called me, sent me an email and sent someone up, and no joke, 5 minutes later I had a new room. I highly recommend this hotel. "
787,"Great location, AWESOME STAFF (thanks to Vince, Hussein and the other bellmen) and perfect rooms!  Enjoy the Art Deco 12th floor pool and the perfect local! You can get to all the best Chi-town locations from this awesome hotel!"
788,Had a great visit to Chicago and the service at the hotel was excellent.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I found that the hotel reached out in numerous different ways to make sure my stay was satisfactory.  Really enjoyed my time at this hotel. 
789,"I was in Chicago for the week due to work presentations for a new client as well as making my rounds w/ other clients.  The IHG Chicago was incredible.  They upgraded me to a super comfortable suite and made my whole work week very pleasant and smooth.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful w/ anything i needed (eg getting around town, sending out FedEx packages, etc.).  In addition, the location to shopping and food is also a huge plus."
790,"We were a family of 5 staying in Chicago over Christmas for a family wedding. Everything about this hotel was impressive from the attentive, polite staff to the fantastic breakfast to the wonderful pool. Best of all though was the room. If you get a chance book the two bed suite on the 40th floor, 360 degree views of the City and loads of space. Not to be missed!"
791,"My wife and I had a wonderful time at the InterContinental. The rooms a spacious and up-to-date. Everything was very clean. They also have a Starbucks connected to the lobby. Valet service was $75 a day, which is a bit pricey, but the closest public garage was a couple blocks away. "
792,"Hotel is very clean and modern. Staff is exceptional. I also really like having Starbucks in the lobby.  The only negative was not the hotel's fault. The constant fire and police sirens were problematic to say the least. Welcome to Chicago, I guess."
793,We were in Chicago for a business trip. Hector checked us in and provided us with great service. He upgraded our room which was most appreciated. The room was great with a nice view of the city. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the pool also. 
794,"My family and I recently stayed here to celebrate our daughter’s first birthday. During our stay here, we were treated like royalty. The staff was always friendly, polite, and very accommodating especially for our little baby, who can cause a bit of a mess sometimes as babies do. And the dining staff for breakfast was absolutely amazing. The hostess Dinka even noticed when our daughter dropped her pacifier, came over, picked it up, and cleaned it without us even asking. They, also, provided us with snacks to take with for our baby.  Thank you, Dinka and all of the dining staff, for being so hospitable and making our stay an excellent one. We cannot wait to visit again!"
795,"Intercontinental Chicago is a beautiful and convenient place to stay.  Terrific for business and pleasure! Well appointed rooms with a terrific restaurant onsite,  Starbucks just off the lobby was a tremendous bonus!  Loved the fitness center...  And the staff was incredible.  I highly recommend..."
796,"Accommodations perfect, location excellent, and very helpful, friendly, professional staff. Restaurant and bar superb, as was the wine bar. Rooms have all of the creature comforts needed for a business trip ( USB ports, etc) "
797,This hotel was excellent! The staff was courteous and professional. The rooms was very clean. This hotel was a great value for Michigan Ave in Chicago. I would recommend this facility. It’s in the heart of downtown.
798,"We held our daughter's wedding reception in the Intercontinental Grand Ballroom in January, 2020. Approximately 288 guests. We also had over 80 hotel rooms in the room block for the weekend. Our guests were very complimentary on the entire weekend. The Michigan Avenue location was convenient and perfect for out of town guests who wanted to site see. Tara Hubbard did a fabulous job from our first meeting to discuss a potential wedding venue, then the contract details, tasting and menu selection, final walk through, to the actual event date. I can't praise her enough! If you are considering a wedding in downtown Chicago and want it run right, give them a call!"
799,My time at this hotel was magnificent! I spent my time celebrating with friends. The location was great. Close to great dining and entertainment. The room was beautiful. The bed was comfortable. The staff was pleasant and took care of all my needs.
800,So this review is way late and I will update with new pictures when I go in a few weeks but this is by far one of the best hotel stays I've had in my travels. The hotel is beautiful (although it has gone through an extensive renovation. New pics coming in my update). I stayed in a cityview suite for my birthday and the staff and service were exceptional. The location is close to the northern part of the Mag mile with easy access to all of the high end shops and restaurants in the area. I don't usually stay at the same hotel twice but it spoiled me so! Can't wait for my stay in a couple of weeks
801,"Spouse and I stayed two nights.  Decor beautiful. Room, nice.  Staff were quite friendly. Room service food very good.  Dog friendly. Great park nearby for dogs. House phone in room horrible. 1980’s technology. Didn’t work properly. Toilet paper was horrific.  Reminded me of something you would find in low budget hotel.  Considered dropping a star rating over it, but wouldn’t be fair to hotel. However, issue needs addressed by management.  Overall, recommend.  "
802,"Have stayed at Four Seasons Chicago as a staycation occasionally over the years, and so made it out go to place for our anniversary.  They treated us like All Stars from start to finish.  The place looked great, and the location is perfect for some Gold Coast shopping and eating (including their relatively new restaurant - which was great).  But more than anything, the service and attention to detail wins us over every time. "
803,"I spent the weekend at the newly renovated Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago and I have to say, it's my new favorite home away from home in Chicago!    The renovation is gorgeous from the beautiful lobby and lounging areas with plenty of space to social distance to the spacious rooms and suites which are beautifully appointed.  My view from my lake-view room was gorgeous at every turn, from morning arrival to the twinkling night lights of Chicago to the most gorgeous sunrise across the horizon, it was magical!  Service was the usual spectacular 5* service one gets at a Four Season and Chicago has down perfectly.  I needed museum tickets, they were in my email in 2 minutes.  Rooms service for breakfast was not only delicious but fast.  Everyone was super lovely, helpful and friendly."
804,"Business trip my toddler tagged along, informed the staff he’d be accompanying me and they went above and beyond. The views ...amazing! The food was great, room service was quick. Valet parking was awesome my car was always ready for me the concierge was very helpful. "
805,"The newly re-opened Four Seasons Chicago hotel is absolutely amazing!  From the moment you get off the elevator on the lobby level to the time you get in your guest room, the entire property is in immaculate condition.  Our room was extremely clean and we felt safe while we were there.  The hotel has staff checking temps upon arrival to ensure both staff and guests are healthy before entering the hotel.  The guest room product is second to none.  Also, the wings are the restaurant, which take 72-hours to prepare, are worth a trip alone.  If you're in the Chicago area and are in need of a life-changing experience, order those wings!  And have a few of their amazing cocktails and stay the night.  You will not regret it.  Hands down my favorite hotel in Chicago."
806,"This hotel is beautiful! The service was terrific! The location is the best!  From check in, the room was beautiful, drinks in the lounge and snacks were delicious. The public space with all of the art, amazing furniture- wow! I did not want to leave.   They really take special care of the guests during these covid times. They have friendly greeter at the door that takes your temperature with an amazing touch less face scan that takes your temperature. They provided a wonderful checkin amenity of face masks, sanitizers and cleaners in the guest room. I appreciated the high level of care and how serious they take to ensure confidence.  I did not want to leave 2 nights were not enough!"
807,"My wife and I were guests of the Chicago Four Seasons this past weekend.  Our whole experience was excellent.  From arrival and check-in, to the room (what a view), to in-room dining, to cocktails in the beautiful lobby, we felt very pampered. The staff were attentive and personable and really took great care of our needs.  If you have not been here since their new remodel, book your reservation today!  You will be glad you did.   Matt & Cindy Peterson Saugatuck, MI."
808,"Had such an awesome experience staying here! Staff is wonderful and on top of things whenever you need anything. Located in a great spot as well, close to everything. Definitely made my first time in Chicago an awesome time!"
809,"Our stay was amazing! The staff was very kind, helpful and accommodated to all of our needs and more. One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at, very clean, aesthetically pleasing and the location was great. Will be returning!"
810,"Unbelievable experience on all fronts - from checking in to dining at Adorn, I was blown away at the quality of service. The staff took all the necessary steps to ensure we felt safe and comfortable with the current state of the pandemic. The room was spotless and the views of the city were breathtaking. Can't wait to return!"
811,"First Class service by all interactions, both in person and over the phone. All team members exemplify the definition of Hospitality and I can now see why they are a Forbes 5Star property. I apologize I do not recall all names, but major shout out to Jillian the Concierge who obviously enjoys her job and seeing others happy.  We will definitely be back!!"
812,"In uncertain times, it is such a luxury to be able to travel. If you are going to be away, the best place to go is somewhere that feels like home...where the people are so welcoming, it feels like you have known them forever. A place where, when you walk through the front door, a feeling of luxury, comfort and excellence embraces you. That is the Four Seasons Chicago.   I am not a professional reviewer. I’m just a woman with a job who wants to support the hard working folks inside hospitality. Of all the luxury hotel options in this city, the Four Seasons Hotel Chicago is the best and I’ll show you why.  #1 - the staff. Best team in the business. Though this is their job, you never think that because the service they deliver is so natural and authentic. They are knowledgeable"
813,"This Hotel really has five stars! In our travel around Chicago, we wanted to spend time in the property , It was my first time in Four Season and its rooms clean, excellent location and the best service."
814,Wishing all of the team the best in these difficult times. Let’s work together to beat this. Clearly we do not have much leadership and guidance from those that profess to know everything!  Stay safe all! We look forward to our next excellent cocktail in your property once we finally get through this. 
815,"Overlooking the Great Lake it is primely locates for all the great things Chicago has to offer, recommend this hotel opt for a higher floor to enjoy the panoramic views of the lake and the city. Enjoy"
816,"Perfect location. Walk to best restaurants. View of water. First Class Wilber, Monica and Rachel made me feel that i was the only person in the Hotel. I have stayed in Chicago before, but i would be lucky to never stay at any other place!"
817,"I usually stay at the Four Seasons when in Chicago.  Last week I tried another highly rated hotel and wish I'd stayed at the Four Season!  To me the Four Seasons is the benchmark of service and continually offers a quality experience.  The other hotel did so much on par with the Four Seasons but their restaurant experience for breakfast was disappointing both mornings.  Why take chances when traveling, especially these days?  "
818,"My husband and I stayed here one night for a little R&R. We have stayed at other Four Seasons properties and have always been impressed. Typically we stay at the Peninsula when in the city but decided to give this property a try. We were upgraded to a lakefront suite, which was a nice surprise. The staff were all friendly and welcoming upon check-in. The room was small but tastefully designed. Everything was going well until we realized that there was absolutely no way we were going to get any sleep at night. Apparently something to do with the hydraulics of the building, its tall height and its windy lakefront location come together and cause incessant creaking/crackling sounds all night. There was no sleep to be had. We thought it was strange that turndown service had left"
819,"We have never had the opportunity to stay in a high end hotel in Chicago and the Four Seasons did not disappoint.  From arriving at the curb in a cab the bellman was friendly and very good at his job.  The front desk check in was efficient and we were very excited about an upgraded room to a Lake Michigan view.   We were shown around the spa pool area by a very helpful woman who helped us with slippers and robes while showing us how the lockers worked.  The pool area was not too busy but it was a Sunday night also.  The hot tub was nice and hot, even the pool was not very  chilly.   Breakfast was delightful the next morning and it was nice to relax before heading out to shop on Michigan Ave.   We definitely were spoiled and will be back again. We had a nice relaxing weekend"
820,"We have stayed in Chicago many times, staying at many different hotels. This Four Seasons is my favorite. The comfort, special treatment , perks more than make up for the higher price. There are times I have booked a hotel to save money that has ended up being a nightmare, even in the higher priced chains. Four Seasons has offered my consistent stress free stays. I highly advise a try. It is conveniently located just of the magnificent mile across from Bloomiingdales and near Watertower. "
821,"I stayed at the Four Seasons during NBA All-Star Weekend. The first night of my 5-night stay was sleepless, as noises from plumbing, guests upstairs, and constant creaks from the wind kept me awake all night. Thankfully I had a friend staying at a neighboring hotel and was able to sleep there for my next 4 nights. After night 3, earplugs were left on the nightstand with a note saying that the wind was the root of the problem for the noise. Sorry, I'm not staying at the Four Seasons to wear earplugs in order to sleep.  The restaurant and bar were closed due to renovations, and the pop-up restaurant was in a bland conference room. Again, not something I expect from the Four Seasons. "
822,"The lobby is undergoing significant changes to be brighter and more contemporary.  It’ll be fun to see it when the rest of the lobby, the restaurant and bar renovations are complete.  The friendly and professional service remains unchanged and unparalleled.  From the doormen to housekeeping staff, no hotel in Chicago treats guests better or offers a better stay.  Don’t stay away during the construction."
823,"This hotel didn’t feel like the Four Seasons.   My son kept calling it the One Season :). It’s under construction and there is no bar or restaurant.   But that wasn’t the worst of it all.   Our bathroom shower design left a large puddle of water on the floor after every shower and the plumbing is just old (not much water pressure either).  We complained three times but nothing changed.   The hotel is just old, the building creaks at night (due to wind outside, but still).     Seriously, the stay was really no nicer than a any mid tier hotel.  Based on this experience I don’t think I’d stay at a Four Seasons in general.   BTW, the people working there are very nice and the doormen outside were fantastic, friendly and helpful.   But overall not worth the price with other options"
824,"We have come many times with our children...they absolutely love it! The staff is fantastic and makes the experience. Between the pool, milkshakes in the room, and the local sites to see it is always a memorable experience!"
825,"Our kids first trip to Chicago could not have been better! We booked the Family Fun in the City package and it was fantastic! Make sure you schedule your visit from the Ice Cream man when you book your room because the time slots do fill up. Thank you to all the staff who helped make traveling with our children as memorable as possible! They loved all of the goodies at check-in, the snacks and extras that were waiting for them when we would arrive back after a long day of exploring the city. A special thanks to the concierge team who sent up another stuffed ""Sammy"" after our original Sammy went for a swim in a toilet while attending a show!  The pool is amazing and we had it all to ourselves for an hour or so on a Friday afternoon. My kiddos love the Home Alone movies and it was"
826,"Disappointed to the learn the hotel restaurant and bar were out of commission. I should have been told in advance. I would not have stayed at the Four Seasons if I knew the restaurant was unavailable. Also, when I booked a spa appointment, I had to go through the front desk because the spa was closed for a month and I was booked with an incorrect treatment."
827,"I am currently at the 4S in Chicago and it is undergoing renovation. While the lobby restaurant and bar are being renovated, the service is still excellent as are the food and drinks. The rooms are wonderful. The location on the Magnificent Mile is outstanding."
828,"A really great experience! The people were kind, the room was spacious, the view was beautiful.. right on the Magnificient Mile. It's just one of these hotels you can't stop recommending to your family and your friends visiting the city."
829,"This is my 6th trip to chicago.This was my first stay at four seasons and somehow it didn't live up to its expectations  i think for me the disappointment was the pool ( the main reason i stayed here was for the pool). When i went to swim i saw FOURTEEN kids in the pool at 8pm. the water was mirky, they were consuming food in the poor and after one length , my hands caught some hair and some ""Thing"" else that i couldn't identify. the adults were drinking from glass containers and there was broken glass at one end of the pool edge. I reported this to the spa manager who informed me that it would be taken care of after the pool closed. after that i couldn't actually bring myself to go the pool anymore. i am sorry to say i wont be staying here anymore ."
830,"I want to give this hotel 5 stars but the pool situation with the kids is out of control. I picked this hotel because of the pool and it was over ran with children. They have an adults only time but it’s from like 9pm to 10pm. If I’m in downtown Chicago that’s the last place I’ll be at 9pm. I highly recommend they find a solution or make two adults only times. 1pm-2pm and 9pm-10pm.   The room had an amazing view and the staff was very friendly. Valet parking is expensive so be prepared. The complimentary coffee, got chocolate was outstanding and it’s connected to a shopping plaza so that’s nice. Great location as well. "
831,The hotel has a prime location with breathtaking views. The staff is attentive and purposeful. The rooms  are very well maintained and all the services offered by the hotel are world class. I have stayed in most of the 5 star hotels in Chicago and the Four Seasons is by far the best!
832,Stayed for my daughters annual birthday celebration. This year she is nine. The pool is wonderful. The location is perfect (neighbors of american girl). 900 north shopping and hotel issued discounts to stores makes shopping all the more enjoyable.
833,"The management & staff of FS Chicago exceed our expectations every time. No challenges are too great for the FS team. Our family members , young and old,  consider it our home away from home during the Holidays."
834,"This was our second time staying at the Four Seasons Chicago. We travel to Chicago regularly and we switch back and forth between 4 top hotels depending on availability and price. This time we chose the Four Seasons because our previous stay was memorable, it was disappointing that when we made our reservation we were no informed that the lobby and restaurant are under renovation. It did make our stay less enjoyable, breakfast is only available via Room Service, the food was good but not what we are used to have at the Restaurant. There is a temporary cafe in the lobby area that offers coffee and light bites. Aster Hall in the 900 Michigan Avenue Mall is a great option, you just take the elevator to the 6th floor. Last time the Ice Cream Man made a visit to our room, this time"
835,This is a nice quality hotel with a great location. Four Seasons is always dependable for great service and comfortable rooms. We had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan from our room. The restaurant at the property is solid. We had breakfast here each morning and a couple of lunches. Fantastic service a good food.
836,"We stayed here during a layover on our way to our honeymoon and were upgraded to the Executive Suite. Like most Four Seasons, the room was perfectly maintained and comfortable. I wish we were able to stay for more than one night! The pool and spa were great as well (despite some loud children splashing around), and the breakfast buffet was delicious with a large assortment of options. We will definitely stay here the next time we're in town!"
837,Had the opportunity to stay here one night in December of 2019.  The room was fantastic and I really enjoyed the lake view upgrade.  The pool was great as it had a dedicated lane to swim laps and a welcoming hot tub to soak in after a work out.  The only downside right now is that the hotel does not have an on-site restaurant or bar as it is undergoing renovations.  This was not posted when I made my non-cancellable reservation however the hotel did call prior to my visit to let me know.
838,"The staff at Four Seasons Chicago was attentive, courteous and caring.  From entering the hotel to check-in and check out.  The room was spacious with a great city view and very comfortable.  Large bathroom with double sinks, large tub and shower.  Very clean and comfortable, as usual with Four Seasons.  Had a great friends weekend."
839,"Great staff, great arrival and departure service, over all what you want from 5* lux pro-service on all levels. Will be back for sure during my next travel to Chicago. Note: if you travel with your dog this is the place to stay - the service on this front was worth every dollar. "
840,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for a few nights while in Chicago on vacation.   The hotel is fairly well situated. While we were in Chicago, we visited Willis Tower, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, and the River Walk. None of them are really within walking distance of the hotel, but they're all about a five minute Uber away.  We booked two rooms, which were right next to each other and were mirror images. While the hotel lobby is around about the 7th floor, the rooms start somewhere near the 30th floor, so there really are no low-floor rooms. We had rooms on or around the 40th or so floor, facing back towards the city (rather than the lake). While I expect the view on the other side of the building is better, our 'city view' was nothing to sneeze at. Both rooms were very nicely"
841,Great from start to finish.  Staff was great with kids.  Schedule the ice cream man to visit your family if you can.  The pool was great for the whole family during our stay.  Would recommend this property to anyone.
842," The location of the four seasons hotel is absolutely ideal. The staff is incredibly accommodating and the service is beyond outstanding.  The views of Michigan Avenue, the John Hancock  and the lake make this a truly iconic property. "
843,"You don’t realize what you’re missing in a hotel stay until you visit the Four Seasons.  They anticipated every need I had and needs I didn’t even know I had - like leaving me a really bookmark for my book on my nightstand.  The staff were extremely friendly and go out their way to help out.  We were traveling on business for my husband and received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful view of Lake Michigan.  The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I’ve ever slept in!  The fitness room is on the smaller size, working out in the morning I was restricted to only cardio.  There were personal trainers taking up the weights section.  Thank you Four Seasons for providing excellent service and being so friendly, we look forward to future stays!"
844,"First of all, this is a good hotel. I was also upgraded to a suite on the 43 floor and that was stunning. However, overall the hotel feels dated and tired and it a huge disappointment.   It is also annoying to have to get one set of elevators to the 7th floor to get the lobby, and then take a different set to the rooms.   This is an expensive hotel and it is simply not worth the money ..."
845,"Just finishing up our 4 night stay. Overall service levels that one expects from a 4 Seasons are lackjng. No anticipation of the guests needs. Very overpriced for quality provided. Outdated facility that is not up to 5 star standards. 1) Greeting and Checkin-Good. Bags brought up to room quickly and check in fine. 2) Room had a beautiful Lake View but small standard size...not current 5 star standards. Bathroom for wheelchair users an afterthought. Knobs for water on front wall of shower...not handy for wheelchair user on a bench.  Room dimensions small for manevering around. Very loud HVAC---like a low quality hotel. 3) Bar very nice with good service. Comfortable to relax. Cheese plate, wings and cocktails above average. 4)Menu-uninspiring....not current..old fashion"
846,"Perfectly located for shopping and great walks to the lake or down Michigan Avenue. Overall the staff is quite nice and welcoming but the hotel has only one restaurant with a very limited menu if you want to eat healthy foods.  In dining menu is even more limited and prices are very expensive once you add the tax and room service charge. I had to pay $38 for a glass of very bad Cabernet.!! My room was standard and ok but no frills.  I had a massage at the spa, where the reception staff was very kind and helpful but the 50mns massage at $220 was a joke. The masseuse used oils and when I asked about the offered scrub, she said she always does it afterwards?? She only did a small part of my back. And the hot stones? Two stones to massage you with... disappointed.  The worst was at"
847,"In the current day of chrome and glitz, the Four Seasons Hotel stands asa  grand dame of fine living. The ambience of the hotel is supported by the decor with its dark wood and traditional furnishings and enhanced by the attentive and friendly staff both provide an memorable experience. I am relaxed at the Four Seasons Hotel. My partner and I would not think of staying at another property. "
848,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Four Seasons Chicago.  Everyone was amazing, from receptionist at check-in who upgraded our room to suite, to bellboys, concierge, and all other staff that we interacted with.  Dinner at Allium was exceptionally good.  Location is very convenient, right across from Water Tower and above 900 Shops, yet it feel very private.  We would highly recommend this hotel and will be back."
849,"We stay here annually for our 'staycation'. The hotel is in a convenient location and guest rooms are very comfortable. My kids (7 and 5) are always welcomed with a trip to the 'treasure chest' and have a welcome amenity on the beds in our room. This year we had cookies and milk awaiting at our check-in as well. The kids also love the pool and could spend the day there, especially in the winter. Overall it's a great place to stay in Chicago."
850,It was a couple weekend at the hotel with shows and a parade to see. The location of this hotel right off the Mag Mile was perfect. A great room and wonderful service in a beautiful hotel made our weekend a fantastic one.
851,"I always stay at the Four Seasons when available and this was my first stay at the Chicago Four Seasons and it met all of my expectations.  The location was excellent as it was walking distance to two of my three meetings and there are so many great restaurants within walking distance as well.  I had a beautiful lake view suite and as always, everything worked, housekeeping was wonderful, furniture was all in good shape and comfortable."
852,"Nice hotel with a great location a couple blocks north of the Water Tower.  Our high-floor 1BR suite had spectacular views north and east over the lake.  However, parts of the room felt in need of a touch up / renovation (some peeling wallpaper, nicks etc.)  The staff generally provided the usual excellent Four Seasons service, though seating at brunch was limited and service lacking (needing to hunt down the waiter, utensils and foods running out at the buffet, etc).    Overall a nice experience but not enough that I would again pay a premium to the other excellent 5* hotels that are within a few blocks."
853,"Zero complaints. The staff is great throughout, they made my children and I feel very special. The spa, amenities, and atmosphere were a haven from the busy but great city of Chicago. Allium, the restaurant in the hotel, delivered every time with great food and service, especially the cocktails. "
854,"We had a lovely room - full suite with two bathrooms.  The technology in the room trails the Peninsula.  Staff are friendly, but again, just one step behind.  We spent more that 100 nights at Four Seasons in 2019 - Hualalai and Surf Club.  Both of those have staffs that are a bit more on top of things.  Dining is another area this property could use a boost."
855,We are frequent guests here and it never disappoints.   Love going to Allium for pre-dinner cocktails.  Service is attentive but not intrusive.   Kevin enjoys the gym and sauna.  I love that he’s happy being here.  We will be back soon.
856,Excellent service and amenities!  Stayed here for a long anniversary weekend earlier this month.  This hotel will definitely be on our list for the next time we travel to the wondy city.   Spa experience is top notch.
857,"I have been fortunate in my life to stay at many of the finest hotels. The Chicago Four Seasons ranks with the best. It is not glitzy, just comfortably elegant. The room was exceptionally large by city standards and well designed for comfort and business. Housekeeping seemed to go a step beyond. They make their guests feel appreciated, all in an understated way. "
858,Excellent service and a first class property.  Everything was perfect from the valet when I arrived to the checkout process when I left.  My room was clean and spacious and I had a great view!  I'll definitely stay there again. 
859,"Very good hotel, large size room & bathroom located in the heart of the city, downtown. Stayed on 45th floor, view was excellent from there. All major shopping and dining destinations with in 5 minutes walking distance. Didn’t have food there. Staff was courteous enough."
860,"We have stayed at this hotel in the past, and did not have as great of an experience this time. We were promised an upgrade upon check-in, waited an additional few hours for the upgrade, only to be taken to the same room we had booked. The room was not as clean as we expected- the comforter had stains on it and the heat was stuck at 66 degrees. Of course it took us a day to realize the thermostat wasn't working, so we spent quite a bit of time in the cold before having the staff address the problem. Overall, the stay was just average, and wasn't the Four Seasons quality we typically enjoy and expect."
861,"I stayed there for 3 nights and there was not one thing that would need improvement.  This hotel is amazing! The location, staff, cleanliness.... Food was good. The city view is amazing and you just can't go wrong.  It is close to everything you would like to see in Chicago.  I did not want to leave!!! "
862,We had exceptional service. Restaurant always willing to accommodate us as well as the staff.  Hotel is centrally located in the heart of the city. Walking distance to great restaurants.This hotel is our number one pick every time!
863,"Been staying here for years.  The rooms have recently been upgraded.  The executive suite looked fantastic and was very functional.  Desk is gone and replaced with a table and chairs.  Service as usual was top notch. Room service was excellent.  Nice pool and gym.  Parking, though, is steep--70 dollars a night."
864,"I booked a 4 day sightseeing trip with my 12 year old niece and the Four Seasons made the trip even more memorable for her by giving her cute little gifts each day and by the concierge giving us such great recommendations on where to go and what to see.   The room was perfect. Very spacious with a Great Lake view. Room service and housekeeping were top notch. Excellent turn down service every evening.   Special thanks to the night manager, Raul Ibarra, who showed great kindness and professionalism when I had a dispute with my credit card company. It was not the Four Season’s fault but he stepped up to make it right and I really appreciated it. "
865,"Always have a superb experience at this hotel. From the bellhop staff to the housekeeping to the front desk, I am made to feel like royalty.  I try to make this the hotel I stay at when I'm in Chicago for business or pleasure. "
866,Awesome service!  Greeting personally at desk.  Room service On Time and hot! Great gym and pool area.  Great location in Chicago connected to inside shopping mall. Restaurant food very good though could use greater variety of entrees. 
867,Four Seasons Chicago a peak experience. The accommodations and hospitality unsurpassed! The lobby bar really lovely and the menu was great. Sunday brunch so elegant. The service on point and the staff so generous helpful. The accommodation s so comfortable. I can’t wait to return to the Windy City and the Four Season’s will be my destination of choice.
868,My wife and I were at the hotel recently for a wedding of a close friend. One word - Outstanding! Everything from arrival to departure was perfect. Best place to experience a wedding that you get to enjoy. We have our youngest daughter getting married next year and this gave us some wonderful ideas.
869,"Love this hotel, it was quite an experience.  We went for our anniversary as a stay-cation and to relax at the spa.  The location is great. Everything you could possibly need is right there.  The pool, hot tub, and saunas are great.  Hotel staff is friendly and accommodating.  Great for business travel or couples get-a-way, or even a family/friends vacation."
870,The Four Seasons is secluded yet assessable to everything you want to do in Chicago.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  We loved the  entire experience.  The hotel room was totally equipped with anything one could need.  The restaurant for breakfast was delicious and offered many great choices. The people were friendly and helpful. 
871,Best value at the luxury end. Have stayed at all the top hotels and the Four Seasons is more fairly priced. Breakfast is pricey but there are lots of good options in the neighborhood. Concierge was super helpful.
872,"My first and only stay (until now) at this Four Seasons was a number of decades ago, probably before the internet's debut.  A horrific experience with a horrific front desk staffer at both check-in and check-out, plus the hotel's non-response to my written complaint (this was back when guest surveys were completed on paper and mailed), kept me away from the Four Seasons in the ensuing years, during which time I would stay most frequently at the Ritz Carlton (which was then a Four Seasons hotel as well), the Langham (in Mies van der Rohe's IBM Building), and the Hotel Burnham (now the Staypineapple) in the historic Reliance Building in the Loop.  I was enticed back to the Four Seasons for this trip by a great rate offered by my Chicago-based professional association.  I'm happy"
873,"We love to come to Chicago for special birthdays or occasions. Our favorite hotel by far is the Four Seasons. The staff, the food, everything is first rate. The sleeping accommodations are amazing! Every experience is executed with such care. "
874,"Fantastic location, clean, well maintained, okay it could do with a brightening up job but the helpful staff certainly made up for it.  The concierge ladies couldn't do enough for us and were there the next day to check everything had gone to plan, normally you use the concierge desk and never see the same people again but these girls remembered everything they had done for us and made sure we were happy.  Great room fab view, check in desk very professional and pleasant, doormen great, I love a doorman with personality and these guys definitely had that."
875,"The location of the hotel is so convenient.  The staff is just super good. I can't say the best as it was my first time in Chicago.  Any way  from the super doorman to the restaurant the whole staff I have been in contact with..they are all kind, quick, nice..smiling.. bravo.  Regarding the hotel itself  there is nothing magic apart the magic view I had from my room.  The deco of the lobby is 80's , old fashion.  My suite was large ..but neutral...sad.  Bathroom are so so overaged BUT SUPER WELL MAINTENAIDED.  I am really impressed by the so good condition of the bathroom as it is looking so hold. Everything is super clean and perfect condition.  It is a perfect CORPORATE hotel.  I hope the new decorations and restoration  of the hotel will bring more magic.."
876,"Had another wonderful long weekend away at Four Seasons  Chicago! Stayed with four other couples and everyone absolutely loved the accommodations, location, hotel amenities and staff. It’s a special place and we look forward to going back soon!"
877,This staff obviously doesn’t under stand the luxury hotel market. Has never stayed at this four seasons before but have in many other cities without problems. It was basically like service at a courtyard Marriott. You can do lots better by staying somewhere else. 
878,"Great service. Specially the concierge service; she went the extra mile to make sure our plans were exactly what we wanted.  Also, the rooms were nice and clean, and the front desk service was as good as you would expect from any Four Seasons hotel.   Great job overall!  Highly recommended! "
879,"The hotel is old an needs renovation. Some rooms are renovated ( they said ) but its just re decorated ! We are four seasons Regulars but this one was different. I asked the first day if possible i would like to talk to the front desk manager or assistant of manager and i was told they will for sure call me. we stayed for 3 nights and nobody contacted me. The suits does not look like pictures you see in website. not at all!! It was some kind of disappointments compares to all four seasons hotels we have been. Arron at  Breakfast  was  very very professional . They have 2 Arrons . I am talking about the Blond Arron. He was amazing. i think he deserves to be the manager. He could handle everything correct, fast, was friendly very professional. Great .Thank you Blond Arron."
880,Nice hotel and location.  The bed was comfortable.  I was staying for 2 night for work and wanted to do some exercise.  The front desk informed me I needed to make an appointment to use the gym and they charge for the use of the gym. :-(
881,"My room was great, staff nice and friendly. Upon checking in I asked how much is valet? The guest attendant  said $76 with in and out privileges. Even told me most people use an app called SpotHero if there just parking. But since I was going to be going in and out I just chose to valet. Upon trying to take my car out I was informed by the valet,  I’m not entitled to in and out privileges because I didn’t pay with the hotel. I wish the hotel would make this more clear upon checking in. Beware"
882,"Stayed for one night and everthing was fine. Asked for a calm room and got one. Check-in was swift and staff was friendly. In the light of Covid-19, the hotel takes hygiene very seriously. Cleaned and sealed rooms, cleaning swipes in the room and the tv remote was wrapped in plastic. Would stay here again."
883,We stayed 2 nights and I can’t say enough about how great the staff treated us. The hotel is clean and newly redone. Highly recommend this hotel!  We had a bunch of camping stuff that we were able to store without having to lug it up to our rooms. Our rooms were clean and very comfortable.  
884,Everything I needed for an quick emergency trip to visit a family member.  Hotel appeared to make all the required pandemic precautions.  Hotel bar remained open which was nice.  Most importantly it was in a safe and convenient location to get everywhere I needed to be on foot.  Will most definitely return.
885,"If you have concerns about your health, don’t stay at this hotel. The hotel staff doesn’t wear masks and doesn’t care if other patrons have face coverings either.  Rooms are basic. Location is good, however.  What a joke."
886,"From the minute we pulled into the drive, we were treated like VIP’s.  The valet parking staff were courteous and professional.  Ed the bellman and the others were fun and engaging.  You had the sense that they enjoyed their job and wanted to make sure their guests felt comfortable and at home. The front desk staff were polite and efficient.  We encountered Monse and Denise during our stay and they were both a pleasure to deal with.  I can not say enough good things about Russell the concierge on duty the weekend we were there.  He was quite simply put, AMAZING.  He answered many questions prior to our arrival and then greeted us with a friendly smile that made us all feel like we knew him for years.  I am not sure if I have ever had such a positive hotel experience in Chicago"
887,"First time traveling to Chicago and could not have chosen better hotel! I loved the stay at Hotel Chicago, everyone was stupendous with helping us accommodate especially Russell. He helped us throughout our whole trip regarding places to eat and what attractions to go to!!! I definitely will be booking here on our next trip!"
888,"While checking in, Lakisha not only gave me 110% guest service but she treated me as I was a VIP. People, that's what I call amazing guest service. When checking in, make sure you ask for her she'll treat you as your a VIP..."
889,"Had a few problems with my room and while the front desk was very apologetic, they couldn’t move me - they could only offer points. Two days later I left my key in my room and went to get a new one. Trevor was working and he asked how my stay was and I told him fine but then mentioned the problems. Without hesitation or request, he offered a solution and moved me to a fantastic new room with a king bed and river view. He didn’t have to. Technically the hotel had already “solved” the problem but Trevor didn’t see it that way. The bar is also totally worth a visit. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Especially Kat. She recommended a wine to my partner that he really enjoyed and made me a top notch rye old fashioned. Executive lounge was small but adequate with attentive and kind"
890,"I have stayed twice in this hotel Feb 1st - Feb 2nd and Feb 7th - Feb 8th. Both stays are excellent! The beds are very comfortable. The room is so beautiful and luxurious. Also, the room is really soundproof which can make me sleep so deep at night. Also, breakfast are really delicious. Furthermore, the hotel has a great location. I feel this is one of the best hotels in Chicago, I definitely would like to stay again in this hotel next time. 10 out of 10 for the rating!   Bocong Zheng Mar. 9th, 2020"
891,The Good: - Fantastic location right near the river on State Street. - Easy walk to shopping and theaters on State Street - Unbelievable government rate for a Chicago Hotel. Far below the official Per Diem rate.   - Super friendly valet people that park your car. - Was upgraded to a huge suite with two full bath rooms and great river view. - Front desk people were all very helpful and friendly. - Concierge lounge just off the lobby was big and beautiful - Lounge was open on the weekend for breakfast and to get water and soda. - Breakfast in the lounge was one of the best lounge breakfast we have ever had. - Elevators were fast - Floor to ceiling windows in the room and living area.  Maybe could improve - Furniture in the room seemed banged up and dated - Light near the bed was
892,"This hotel was awesome. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was constantly good throughout my stay. My room was nicely cleaned and restocked with towels everyday. The bellman, especially Rich, was super helpful during my stay by assistant with my luggages and ride services. It’s in a really good location. The view of the river is beautiful. Anyone staying here would enjoy their visit"
893,"Visiting the city to celebrate my wife’s birthday and Hotel Chicago never disappoints!  Sharlene and staff are always fantastic.  Room impeccable, great location.   Will return time and again. See you next time! Thank you.  "
894,"Love love love Hotel Chicago.  We travel to the city several times a year and have made this our home base.  From the attention to serving their guests, prime location, and quality accommodations- can’t beat it!! And a big special thanks to Sharlene for always taking care of us.  We’ll see you soon Thanks!!!"
895,"Located immediately next to great bars and restaurants.  Directly located on the river with iconic views.  Awesome breakfast at Yolk, cool bar/bowling, and fun bar ping pong joints are literally steps away.    Staff are attentive and great to work with.  Front Desk assc Lakisha is awesome!"
896,We booked this hotel as a Marriott Gold Member.  They usually do a really good job.  Price was good but maybe too good as valet parking was near $80 and not much other parking around.  The rooms were above average for Chicago rooms.  I was bummed that as a Gold Member I never get an upgrade...so on the 14th floor we did not see much of the river.  I did appreciate the 2 pm late check out!
897,"The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful. The bar is definitely worth visiting for drinks and food, and definitely try to stop by Katana. Our entire experience was really amazing. We will most certainly be back for another visit. "
898,"We recently stayed in a junior suite at Hotel Chicago for a mini family getaway. Though the hotel was busy with guests in a full lobby, hotel staffers Wayne and Ed went above and beyond to ensure we were warmly greeted upon arrival and took care of our belongings to get them to our room. Our suite was beautiful and spacious with plenty of room to relax, two tv's, and a fully stocked mini bar (they even made sure to add a few special treats to our room to make our first family getaway even more special). The bathroom was huge with so much natural light! My husband particularly enjoyed a drink in the lobby bar and said that Tim (the bartender) makes the best Old Fashioned he's ever had. Room service was great. We also enjoyed a delicious hot breakfast in their concierge lounge"
899,"Stayed in this hotel to see a concert at House of Blues. The room was upgraded for us since we were Marriott members. Joanna checked us in and took care of us for two days. She was the best we’ve had in any other hotel in years. I will always come back here. The room was wonderful. Very clean and retro. Lots of room and big bathroom. We had room service which was outstanding for breakfast but most of all, Joanna helped us with everything from navigating the city to find what we needed to parking. She had more personality and patience than any associate I’ve ever dealt with and I’ve been from Illinois to New York to New England and back to Chicago just in December and January.  Can’t wait to come back!"
900,"My second stay here.  My wife stays frequently.  Rooms are nice and clean and the environment is clean and attended to.  Breakfast is good and the area surrounding the hotel is nice despite current construction.  Easy to get to places to see; just call an Uber.  There are gaps in where/when you can get a variety of good food to eat within the hotel.- the bar option seems limited and there is nothing after 11:00 PM.  An early evening snack/ happy hour foods would be a welcome addition.  The staff here are very good - pleasant and attentive.  I was particularly impressed by Jermaine of the house keeping services   Jermaine went out of his way to be friendly and helpful and my stay was made all the more pleasant for his being there,.  His supervisor should take note of the extra"
901,"Location is great, and the service is always wonderful, but the cancelled service in the lounge is disappointing.  After coming back to the hotel from work it was nice to relax and have  a lite bite in there.  Breakfast is still being served in the morning and I hope they reevaluate bringing back evening service."
902,2nd time at the Hotel Chicago and both times it was a very good experience.  Staff was great and rooms modern and clean.  Location is excellent with a short walk to some great restaurants and Millennium Park.
903,"I have been a few times to thos hotel, for business and with my daughter for leisure. It is very central, as in good location for chicago downtown. Service is very good, personal and I always like when concierge gives me a smile and welcomes me back. Nice spacious rooms. Clean and good pillows, which I like. Great food downstairs in lobby bar. Very happy customer"
904,"This is the third time we’ve stayed at this hotel, each time it is an excellent experience. Staff is wonderful, the lobby bar is perfect, you can grab brunch at Yolk, the beds are amazingly comfortable and the location is perfect!! "
905,"The room was upscale, clean, and relaxing.  The bathroom was large.  The walls were thick so you couldn't hear the neighbors. The hotel is in a great location.  Walking distance to so much! The staff was helpful and friendly."
906,"Fantastic location, next to House of Blues and Marina Towers!!! Close to Mag Mile, and Theaters. Not much for fine dining, but you’re in the heart of the city walking distance to tons of great restaurants. They do have a “Yolk” restaurant attached, which is always good. Taxis seem always available. Very modern spacious room, cool vibes. Great value but had to pay for internet if not a member. Staff very friendly and helpful."
907,I stayed at this property during a snow storm and found this place to be really comfortable. The staff went above and beyond in the short time I was there. I had a slight issue with my room which was out of anyone control and I was in contact with Russell From Hotel Chicago and he went above and beyond to make sure it was addressed and I was happy with the service I received. He will be the reason I come back to this place next month for a work travel stay.
908,Great hotel and service! The valet Murphy was so helpful getting our car parked and the front desk attendant was great too. This is the second time staying at this hotel. It has a bar and an attached restaurant for breakfast in the morning. Close to everything!
909,"1/16/20 stay -- Other than the location, a nice greeting while checking in, and the cocktail I had at the bar, this hotel was a big disappointment. I'm a Marriott Lifetime Titanium Elite (disclaimer) and I don't complain a lot but I'll list a few problems 1)  King Suite (room 1237?) was drab and the climate control in the room was suffering 2) there was no bottled water in the room 2) no glasses in the bathroom 3) It was 18 degrees outside so I thought I'd buy a bottle of wine at the bar and take a bath. The master bathtub was inoperable so I called engineering.  They asked if I'd like to use a straight jaw Channellock pliers to operate the tub (seriously, photo attached) 4) the room wasn't up to cleanliness standards 5) there are more but when I walked to the front desk to ask"
910,"I've been staying here for less than 4 hours and the following things have happened:   1. I tried to take the ""only elevator that goes to the Lower Level"" where the fitness center is. The elevator was broken but there was no sign indicating this. So I took the stairs. When you take the stairs, you have to trip over random drop cloths and broken furniture that's haphazardly placed in the walkway.   2. An employee just unlocked my room with a key while I'm sitting here on the bed and walked in. She noticed me, said, ""oh, sorry!"" and then left. I have no clue what that was about, but I will remember to put the stopper on the door now. Thank goodness I had clothes on."
911,"Every year just before NYE, the hubs and I will spend the weekend in the city and this year we chose Hotel Chicago. From the minute we pulled up to the door, the ""Curbside Maitre 'D"" (Mr. Murphy!) was genuinely welcoming and that warm hospitality was carried all throughout the weekend by every staff member. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious for what we're used to in the city. The location is very safe and just on the rim of all the ""buzzing"" places. The hotel bar is warm and inviting, nicely lit. We had a discrepancy on our bill after our stay and it was taken care of professionally and immediately. The hotel's level of customer service is above and beyond and that's what makes this place fantastic! We look forward to staying there again next year!"
912,From the moment we got there Wayne was always helping us from storing our bags and making sure our room was ready to helping us with directions. The staff in general is very welcoming. I would recommend this hotel for both the staff and location!
913,"This hotel is very close to most tourist attractions downtown and restaurants. The parking is very expensive, however that is a fact everywhere in Chicago. I loved the room, it was tidy and modern. The breakfast in the hotel’s restaurant is fantastic but not included."
914,"This is my second trip to Chicago on an unpleasant errand that has me working all hours in a hotel room and, for variety, lounge.  It's a different hotel than last time, and thank God I found it.  The difference is night and day.  The room isn't huge; the amenities aren't overwhelming.  The honor bar is... well, it's like all such; I invested in a trip to Jewel-Osco instead.  Nothing against the selection, of course.  The club lounge, however, has been a life-saver.  Wonderful big breakfast in the morning; delightful hot snacks and crudités in the afternoon -- and stewards eager to go out of their way to help with any little request.  Every single person who works there (and I've met them all this week) has gone out of their way to make sure I'm well taken care of.  I could go"
915,"I was hesitant to stay here as I had read mixed reviews but those turned out to be all inaccurate or from very picky travelers. Note I have the highest status at many chains and fly business class for work and personal. This hotel isn’t the Conrad but it isn’t as bad as some reviews say. The service at the front desk has been phenomenal the past 3 times I have stayed here. Each time, they have been caring and try to accommodate requests.  I am platinum for Marriott so that helps but with Platinum, you will get 1.  Club lounge access (proper club with a full free breakfast served DAILY - the lounge is always open for breakfast even on weekends (7 am to 10:30am). Breakfast is buffet with eggs, two types of sausages, French toast, breakfast potatoes, bread muffins, pastries, fresh"
916,"Hotel is at a very convenient location and the staff is awesome. Very friendly and hard working folks. The two front desk people in particular were Catherine and Trevor and then the guy at the bar (can’t recall the name) was courteous and helpful. All in all, being a picky traveler we had a very good time. Keep it up 👏"
917,"This is a nice hotel to stay in downtown Chicago. The hotel lobby is modern, the rooms are a bit small but comfortable. The bed was good, nice mattress and there is free coffee/tea. Unfortunately the bathroom is old, with a bathtub instead of walk in shower and a very small sink with no place to put your toiletries. The staff at the hotel are helpful and friendly. We loved the fact that many nice places/restaurants/museums/shopping were all walking distance. Beware parking is $ 72 a day. Same price as one night hotel stay!"
918,"We stayed for a night on Dec 22 2019 (one room for my husband, me and baby; other room for my mom). Both AC in two rooms were not working.  Rooms were warm and it was terrible because we were staying with a baby. My mom didnt bother to do the complain but we called front desk at 4am and they sent out a technician to our room. Our baby woke up because of the early morning visit from the technician. The technician was friendly but he didn't solve the issue of our AC. The room was warm so we need to open a window in winter time. This was terrible for a 4 star Marriott hotel. I talked to the front desk before my check out about this issue, she promised me that Manager will email me but I didn't hear back from the Manager."
919,A very nice hotel in a great location.  Staff was friendly.  The lobby and bar area are lackluster but there is a lot to do around the area.  The rooms are dark and the windows are tiny but location fantastic.    I'd stay here again simply for the people and location.
920,"Great place to go to the theatre district, eat, shop, and hop the train to the airport. We had a miscommunication with one our party and had 2 rooms but when explained what happened to Catherine we got to get rid of one of our rooms. She was great to get us just we needed. I need to give a shout out to Wayne and the greeters he works with. They get the job done well and are fun to talk to. They know where to go in the area.  I enjoyed the member’s lounge where it was a quiet breakfast and a place to go so the family could nap."
921,Very pleased in every way at the 2 day stay for my Wife's 50th birthday.  Our concierge Russell Zwolinski was THE BEST!  He went out of his way on his own to set up the room in advance and impressed my Wife and I incredibly.  The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff in general were extremely friendly and with excellent service.  I highly recommend staying here and I know we will be coming back.  Great location too with 2 attached restaurants that I highly recommend.  Katana and Yolk.  Both excellent!  Other major restaurants well within 2-3 min walking distance.
922,Got a great rate at about 100 a night. Was worth it for that price. Would not say it deserves Marriott category five. Service at front desk was slow and the room was okay. Would go back for the right price. 
923,"This is a ideal location in downtown Chicago and I enjoyed my stay at this property.  Everyone I encountered was very cordial and helpful, which made the stay even better.  I would like to recognize Jermaine Harris and Carlisle Myers for the excellent work they provided on the floors and for the great conversation.  These individuals are great ambassadors for the hotel and I again want to thank them for their assistance.  The lobby bar is also a nice place to grab a drink and be sure to try the deviled eggs."
924,"Stayed for a work related event. This was my first time in the city and the very welcoming and professional receptionist Jaz took her time to let me know about the ""can't miss"" sites to visit while in the city. I'm very grateful for her recommendations. I had a wonderful time and will definitely stay at the same hotel next time I'm in town."
925,The location is perfect but the service and linked management isn’t reliable. The room service wasn’t done on one day until 4pm and so we were not able to access the room. The management offered us a water and additional Marriott Bonvoy points which I never received!
926,"Stayed in the Penthouse Suite for 3 nights while visiting Chicago for a girls weekend. The hotel was great with accommodating all our requests of 18 different people.  The Sales Team: Theresa, Hallie, and Jennifer were great with all our constant changes and requests.  The hotel is centrally located and has a nice modern flair.  The Penthouse Suite worked out great for our group of 18 to meet after a busy day just to relax and hang out.  Thanks Again! "
927,"This well overdue relaxation weekend trip kicked off with a great check in experience! Jasmine, thank you for the warm hospitality, professionalism, and recommendations! Hands down the Best hotel stay I’ve had in quite a while!! I travel a lot for work, so it was great to stay at a hotel that felt like home because of its cleanliness, friendly staff, and ambiance! I cannot wait to return!!"
928,I visit here often for work mainly because of the location. The staff here always remembers me and makes me feel welcomed. The bar staff is great and always fun to talk to and they make great cocktails. The door guys are funny and are quick to get me a cab. Desk staff are a pleasure as well! I will always stay here when I visit Chicago.
929,From the smiling and joyful doormen to the front desk everyone is so willing to please. Liliana even went to find us dishes to eat the amazing deep dish the front desk recommended. I know where to stay next time I am in town!!
930,"Right in the heart of down town with everything at walking distance Nice Riverwalk ,restaurants and shopping at the magnificent mile  Friendly staff and big clean rooms with comfortable pillows and bed Good value for money"
931,"I requested a room with a tub. Was told by the front desk that I was given a Deluxe King. When I saw the bathroom, I almost laughed. I had never seen a 3 foot tub before. Fortunately my stay was very short."
932,"I stayed here for 4 days in Oct 2019. I was immediately impressed with the doormen who met my taxi. Wayne and Richard were extremely friendly and inviting and remembered my name for the entire stay. To say I arrived exhausted would be an understatement. I was so tired that I was slurring my speech, but Jaz at the front desk couldn't have been more gracious, patient, and helpful. Rooms were large and clean. There was no noise internally from the hotel, but sirens could be heard from outside pretty much around the clock (I guess that's Chicago?). The hotel is directly connected to the restaurant Yolk, which was nice. The hotel is in a complex with a few bars and restaurants and a bowling alley, and shopping was within walking distance. I had a nice chat with Trevor the manager"
933,"Great location! Great room! Wonderful staff! After long days of shopping and eating fabulous food, we would end our evening in the lobby bar area! Great staff and ambiance! Can’t wait till our next stay in Chicago!"
934,"I stayed at this property for an association annual meeting and I was there for almost two weeks. Being in show management, I have stayed at several hotels but my stay here was the best that I have ever had in Chicago! The front desk staff is phenomenal. They are friendly and welcoming. During check-in, I found out that the gentleman that checked me in (I cannot remember his name) had previously lived in the same county in Maryland where I live right now so we had a lot to talk about. How awesome is that? The bellmen are some of the nicest people. When I returned to the hotel late at night, the bellman/doorman Richard always greeted me with a smile and by name. My view of the city was wonderful and the view at night will leave you in awe. My room was clean, simple yet modern."
935,"Money at the front desk staff was so welcoming. She put us in a large, beautiful room with a nice view of the river. The concierge Russell was so helpful in finding activities and restaurants nearby. After asking for directions to a restaurant they walked us part way there to help us find it and then the next day asked how our meal was.   Our room was a spacious upgrade but it could have used some updating which is why I took off a star. However, the very kind and thoughtful staff made up for the room's dated decor. The lobby was beautiful with a nice fireplace for chilly Chicago days.   The location is in walking distance of some kid favs like Ghirardelli and Sugar Factory.   The concierge lounge, Club Maxwell, is open 24 hours to grab a water or soda which is a nice perk."
936,I was there for a conference with my baby and husband. I truly had an amazing time at Hotel Chicago. Staff were very professional and always ready to help you out. Great thanks to Victor at Club Maxwell. He made our trip :-) Thank you Victor and God Bless you!
937,"I am travel for business and have a high standard when I have travel for hotels for personal stays. My husband and I booked here because of being of it a Marriott boutique property, we were not disappointed at all!  The hotel was clean, the staff were super friendly and accommodating. We got in early and they got us in a room right way even though they were sold out the night before. Our room had a awesome view of the lake and the famous “Corn Cob” buildings.  The hotel is right in the heart of the city action, walking distance to everything. I will stay here again and would recommend it to you! "
938,Ed was great. Made our stay even better. Hotel had everything we needed and was In a great location. The rest of the staff was helpful as well and went out of their way for us multiple times. Thanks hotel Chicago.
939,"The team at Hotel Chicago go ABOVE and BEYOND to make sure you have a great stay. I've not yet encountered a more helpful or friendlier team in my travels. Russell (concierge) is the best of the best and always makes sure I have an amazing experience in Chicago, from booking tours and making reservations to checking in with me throughout my stay to make sure there wasn't more he could do. JD at the front desk was also the kindest and sweetest person and made sure my recent stay for the Chicago Marathon was extraordinary. I will never stay anywhere else when in Chicago! It is also in a great location with big, comfortable, clean, and quiet rooms and close to all public transit and restaurants. Love this place!"
940,"This hotel has a perfect location for downtown Chicago. It is close to everything, yet it is a step back or above everything. The views through the floor to ceiling windows are impressive. The higher, the better. The upgrade we got was awesome. Service is very welcoming. The property is very chic and well designed. It gives you a feeling of understated hip. You can't go wrong here.  If you have a car you want to park here, be prepared to unload $72 a night."
941,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Great central location to everything in the downtown area.  The room was recently renovated, spacious and clean. All of the staff in the main lobby, cleaning and at the bar were friendly and helpful. JD at the front desk was particularly lovely.  Russell at the concierge desk was very helpful in finding restaurants and must see places to go.  Would stay here again when we are in Chicago. Highly recommend it. "
942,"I have stayed at this property many, many times over the past 5 years.  The location of the property is great.   Richard always greets me when I come and go and is always helpful and friendly to everyone.  "
943,"From the moment that I stepped foot in the hotel, JD at the Front Desk greeted me with a smile and was very helpful! She is extremely professional and strives to ensure that your stay will be beyond your greatest expectations! I travel a lot for business, but every time I come to this hotel it brings a smile to my face! Thank you JD for always makimg my stay so wonderful!!"
944,My kids and I are in Chicago for the marathon this weekend. We had a last minute room change request and on this super busy weekend Alicia was able to accommodate our request. It made a huge difference in the quality of our stay. Thank you!!
945,"Great location, big and sophisticated rooms and an amazing team that delivers incredible and friendly service!  Very convenient lounge, high-energy bar and a location in the heart of Chicago.  What's not to love?"
946,"We chose this Marriott property for its location for our family vacation. We asked Karen, the Concierge, for advice for local restaurants and the best architectural boat tour on the Chicago River, Her advice was impeccable!  Thanks to Karen, we enjoyed a couple of wonderful days in Chicago! The front desk staff, Jaz and Kat, also give terrific customer service! Give them all a raise!  Paul  Bosley"
947,"Russell was absolutely amazing! He's concierge agent and he went above and beyond for us: he gave us incredible and in-depth insight on all of the spots and restaurants to check out and gave us a ton of coupons and discounts to keep things affordable. Also, the fact that we stayed here over 2 years ago and he still remembered us is a testament to how amazing he is! Also, can't forget ED, he's one of the bellmen and he remembered us as well! He helped us surprise our best friend for her birthday! The people and service you receive at this hotel is second to none and I will definitely be back!"
948,This hotel is conveniently located right off of the river. It’s also right next to the House of Blues and several restaurants. Service is good And you can walk to restaurant venues without paying for transportation. The service is also very good. I love the fact that the location is central to downtown.
949,"Came here for a weekend getaway with my friends. This was my first time in Chicago and I wanted to do some sightseeing and explore cuisines and nightlife. Russell the concierge went above and beyond to inform us about everything there is to do in the city and more! (THANK YOU RUSSELL!! 😃). He provided us with vouchers for Chicago’s main attractions and local restaurants, truly made us feel at home. If anybody ever needs assistance or information about the city and places to check out, Russell is your guy! "
950,"From checking in to checking out, my experience at Hotel Chicago has been nothing but positive. Even when entering the hotel, you’re greeted by friendly and welcoming staff that are willing to help and assist you with the check in process.   Rooms are spacious and clean. The hallways are kinda dim and dark which can be challenging when finding your room.  I stayed here twice this year for conferences and the staff on the 4th floor were super nice and prompt when serving, cleaning, and assisting us with anything that we needed.   The hotel has a gym in the basement with a few machines as well as a market.  Overall, the best thing about this hotel is the location! You can have somewhat of a view of the river (the obstructed parking garage will get in your way unfortunately). I"
951,"The staff (Jaz) and the property were amazing. Great place to have a corporate event. Placed right in the center of the city with access to EVERYTHING! The rooms were nice and service was excellent. It's easy to access excellent restaurants, bars and nightlife from the hotel. GREAT PLACE!"
952,"Fantastic customer service and accommodations.  Cat made sure I got the room I requested and was a pleasure to work with. She is a true representation of the Marriott brand and the customer service one expects when staying at these hotels. The new rooms make this a true autograph hotel, and I will definitely stay here on my future trips to Chicago."
953,We stayed a week ago for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary. We got a free upgrade and champagne and chocolates when we came back! People were so nice! Room was great! Close to things in Chicago! Will def come back and stay.
954,"We stayed here over the weekend.  The hotel is clean and beautiful.  The pillows are amazing!  My only complaint is that the room food and drink prices are outrageous!  I understand paying a convenience fee, but it really was ridiculous.  Also, I think the parking fee is unreasonable, but I suppose that’s Chicago!  "
955,"I was in Chicago a couple of weekends ago to do some family shopping and cannot praise the Hotel Chicago and their staff enough. We arrived Friday morning and Randy in the lobby was extremely helpful giving us great shopping recommendations in the city. The lounge we were able to use in the morning was awesome and gave us good variety, and the necessary carbs to spend some money shopping in Chicago. The front drive was exceptionally clean!!!"
956,"Hotel Chicago in my mind is that Deacon of Hospitality. I’m had nothing short of a great experience from the time I pulled in and was greeted so welcoming by Wayne in the valet I know the team was solid here. Wayne was knowledgeable and friendly but not over bearing.   Wayne announce me to the front desk and I was swept off my feet. JD, Money, and Irvin was the team that assisted me and they went above and beyond to make sure my stay was what I needed and more. I told them about an incident at a prior hotel and they treated me like the royal family. Even before knowing what had occurred it was evident they all wear a smile with their uniform and take pride in their work. I travel 3 weeks a month for work and this team has raised the standard for me. If you own or manage a hotel"
957,"I have made a habit of choosing the Hotel Chicago from the many options available due to the great employees that work there when I visit Chicago.  I receive warm welcomes from each and every person when I arrive from the valet gentleman, the concierge & front desk staff.  Lakisha & JD in particular were very friendly & warm after my long day of travel.  As an ambassador, it is the little things that make a difference during my frequent nights away from home & Lakisha went out of her way to make sure I had a room that I was most comfortable in.  These high character employees continue to strengthen the Marriott brand & I hope they are recognized for their exemplary performance."
958,I really enjoyed my stay. Room size was nice and bar had great food and service. During my check out I spoke with a Ryan and he was extremely helpful. I can’t to visit again and experience all the partners Ryan spoke of.
959,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Chicago for our first trip to Chicago. We had two MAJOR issues with our stay. Fortunately, both arose on the last night of our three-night stay.  First, the slippery tub needs to be addressed. As many other reviews have noted, the shower is very small, making it difficult to move around. More importantly, the tub is VERY slippery. There is no mat and it seemed like there once were anti-slip strips/stickers but had been removed or completely worn down. My husband slipped and fell out of the shower. Fortunately, he is in his early 30s and is an athlete so he knew the proper way to fall. We told the manager at check-out and although she did apologize, she also did not seem to think it was a big deal. I looked online at prior reviews and there"
960,I traveled 7 hours to come here and got the worst service ever from the front desk rep name Jason. He was very rude to the point I decided to check in at the hotel across the street. After leaving I called him to get corporate number and he replied “Google it” I definitely would not recommend this hotel. With them prices I should have got great customer service. What a night.
961,"Clean, great location and comfortable rooms. Beds are so soft and I had a lovely night sleep!  Very limited contact with staff and the hotel is quiet at the moment so easy to socially distance within the hotel.   Thank you for a lovely stay. "
962,"I have stayed here on several occasions and each time it’s a hit and a miss, never quite making the mark.  I stay here because my employers booked it and not through personal choice. Each time I have been here there has been issues with wake up calls either for myself or for one of my colleagues. This ranges from not getting a call at all or to the wake up call being 15-20 minutes late. I’m sure the generic management response will give COVID as a reason to this unprofessional service however it has been this way for the last few years.  The reception staff on the desk can vary in how welcoming or blatantly rude they are. I find it rather shocking in a country such as America that is apparently so service driven that from some of the employees at this hotel they can behave in"
963,In general the hotel is dated. Ceiling Shower Head not working as it should due to limescale  In room safe doesn’t work Shower floor is disgusting I coffee pod it’s what’s left in your room no cream just dairy powder The cleaning is also unifficient and make sure your room door is properly closed as for twice was left open The receptionist on duty on the night of 20/8 was really a charm not providing any further information than saying no I’m sorry   Not good at all
964,"Was here for business, however in the current situation it was sad not to see all the normal staff at the hotel, especially the amazing doorman. Room was very adequate apart from the iron spitting out dirt on my shirt. Had the problem of only 2 pillows on the bed, this isn't normal and normally have 4 very large ones.  Overall a good stay."
965,"the front desk person was very polite and courteous. The room was a let down. Very small bed was uncomfortable, a king bed but only 2 tiny flat pillows, the room smelled like someone had been smoking bad weed, a starbucks cup was in the refrigerator, the room was not well appointed at all, very tire small and smelled awful.    Would not recommend and would not stay again even if paid to stay."
966,"Once we arrived checking in was efficient and easy. We stayed in the Superior Double Room. The room was spacious and very clean. My favorite feature in the room was the ceiling shower head. The hotel followed Covid-19 protocols with guest wearing mask, providing hand sanitizer, adhering to physical distancing, and allowing limited guest to use the elevator at once . Jason, the manager, professionalism and  attentiveness was superb! He wanted us to have the best experience at the Millennium Knickerbocker! This was an amazing location to relax and explore the great city of Chicago!"
967,There wasn’t a microwave in the room or in the lobby. The biggest problem was the room was not fully cleaning. We found a dirty sock underneath the chairs and we found underwear underneath our bedding.
968,"Before the stay even commenced, I had three employees tell me three different things. One said I could check in early with no fee, another said I have to pay for a FULL night, the last one said they cannot do an early check in at all. I don’t expect to be treated as if I’m special, but it became confusing when I arrived at 4am to an employee telling me I have to pay for a full night when I received a different answer previously. The stay over all went well once we went out and did not have to interact with the employees, but from first impressions it felt like there was no communication or care about giving guest the correct information. As said previously, the hotel is just fine. The staff can be hit or miss."
969,"My husband and I stayed here on our trip around Canada and the US, I loved Chicago especially the river running thru the middle, even on the coldest wettest days there, I just wanted to go out and explore. The hotel (although they didn't advertise it) catered for gluten free, in fact you pretty much ask for what you want.  They made great omelettes although if you asked they did scrambled or poached eggs too.  There is a little food store on site, with a microwave so you can heat shop bought food, a cafe etc.  Some floors had little areas you could sit in for a break from your room, it was clean and tidy and the doorman and bag handlers were very helpful (just make sure you let the bag man carry your bag he stresses out if you don't) although he was very helpful and once in our"

980,Spent 3 nights here and thought it just perfect. Friendly staff and good service. The rooms where clean and were kept immaculate with the daily service. The bar area had a good atmosphere with good seating. Highly recommended to anyone going to Chicago. 
981,"Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. While it is older and doesn't have every amenity that others do, it was a great value that delivered exactly what was needed. Very little interaction with hotel staff, but the hotel is clean, well maintained and has a location that can't be beat. Shocked by how nice the bathroom/shower combo was. Great set-up. Would definitely stay here again."
982,"The hotel is old bottom line; it needs major updates in rooms,  general areas and could be cleaner.  Our first room was a King and extremely small and very loud fan.  I did ask to switch rooms and the second room was much more spacious. The staff is very nice and accommodating and great location.  "
983,"This hotel was exactly as described in its profile. It is well located and the staff were very kind. It has a very traditional big old hotel feel. It was quiet and comfortable. I did wish there was a store or coffee shop in it, but the staff at the door were able to easily direct me to somewhere nearby."
984,"The hotel atmosphere was amazing. Right when you walk in the lobby is very classy, with their tea brunch thing going on everyday. Rooms are spacious, location of the hotel is right in the middle of action. Loved everything about my stay including the friendly staff. 👌"
985,"I stayed here for a few nights last week, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The hotel is in a brilliant location,, 4 minute walk away from a mall and surrounded by small stores to go grab a snack and drink. Room was a nice size with a mini fridge and ironing facilities. Room was very clean and so was the hotel lobby when I arrived! Staff were all brilliant at the hotel, especially David who works outside! Was very helpful with directions and was always happy to have a chat!   Will definitely be back!"
986,"I am staying at the Knickerbocker for a business trip. This is my first trip without my 2-month old baby. I am pumping breast milk and asked for a mini fridge in my room to store the milk. Upon check-in, the hotel radioed for a fridge to be brought to my room. Although the initial fridge that was brought to my room was defective, the hotel did replace it, and I appreciated the service and friendliness of the employee who brought it.   This negative review is because the guest services agent told me a flat out lie, and I do not appreciate being lied to. I also asked if I could have a microwave brought to my room in order to sterilize my pump parts and bottles, as my baby has an underdeveloped immune system and requires regular sterilization of bottles. The agent said that was not"
987,"Stayed here for just one night, check in was an easy process. Very beautiful when you walk in, love the old feel and was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Hotel is very convenient if you want to walk around the city. Very close to the John Hancock building, and backs up to the Louis Vuitton store. I had a king bed room, the room was a little small but most city hotels are, my family had a two queen bed room and it was much more spacious. My only complaint about my stay would be the sheets, they were very thin and paper like and even made crunchy sounds. All in all a good stay though. "
988,"Brilliant hotel and excellent location for everything you will need while your on vacation in a fantastic city,from our arrival to our departure the hotel staff were only too willing and helpful with all our needs.we would thoroughly recommend it."
989,Stayed the night as part of a company holiday trip.  Beautiful accommodations.  I know they want to make money with their in room snacks but they are so ridiculously priced. Overall would keep it in my options for staying at again.
990,We booked a room here for a long weekend. Our flight was getting in late so I called the hotel to let them know. They said not to worry they hold it til 2am. Our flight was delayed further so I called again to let them know again was told not to worry they will hold our room.   We arrived before 2am after a long flight to be told they didn't have any rooms available.  I prepaid for the room and they were putting us in another hotel for the night. I was so upset and tired we just went with it and was told we were going to be compensated.   The hotel they put us up in was even better but the hassle was not worth it.  I knocked a star off for this as I believe this could have been handled better.  The actual hotel is a historic site. The lobby and common areas are dated and need a
991,"First of all  I never leave reviews. However, after contacting the manager and not receiving a call back I think it is important to alert others The hotel was busy with one woman working the front desk. She acted like it was an inconvenience to help us. I can't completely blame her as she must have been overwhelmed. Our room was tiny and smelled. Well, we found out later it likely smelled because the refrigerator wasn't working. Unfortunately, we found that out after I used it for putting my milk from pumping in there which resulted in dumping out 25 oz. of breast milk. Also, the doorman watched me struggle, carrying two bags to open the door (both when he arrived and when we returned)... patrons of the hotel ended up opening the door for me both times. Bartender was not"
992,"I was alone with my four-year-old, who woke up at 2:00 a.m., screaming with an earache. I had forgotten meds, and I was SO stressed that she would wake up other guests. So I bundled her up and took her downstairs, b/c we had to get to Walgreens. I promptly burst into tears when this lovely bellman, Nurrie, asked how he could help. He offered to get me a taxi (but for some reason I walked, in December in Chicago, with a 4-year-old - not my best move - but we made it there and back). Then she refused to take the meds, so we decided to pack it in at 3:30 a.m. (I live in Indianapolis, 3-hour drive). Nurrie was instrumental in helping me get my bags, reminding me of everything I could forget in my frazzled state, and got the valet to get my car even though I couldn't find my ticket"
993,"Stayed for 4 nights on a visit from Florida.  Excellent location just off Michigan Ave.  We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.  Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.  Craig, one of the bellmen, gave us great food recommendations.  Our room was 2 doubles.  Beds were amazingly comfortable.  Bathroom was large and well appointed.  Mini bar was well stocked.  I had breakfast one morning in the Nix restaurant.  I just wanted a bagel and cream cheese which they did and it was delicious.  Lovely lobby area and a nice bar with comfortable tables as well as bar stools.  Got a great rate, we will be back!"
994,"Recently stayed 5 nights in a “corner King” room.  We have stayed at the Knickerbocker many times before, going back many years.  It is a good business-class hotel.  They still do a good job.  BUT.  It turns out they are one of those hotels that will put unsuspecting guests in an “accessible” room without telling them, even though they know full well a “regular” (normal?) room was expected.  I did spot a suspicious-looking toilet immediately upon entering the room with the bellman, but thought nothing of it.  It was way off in a large bathroom, possibly a normal toilet, and the rest of the room looked normal—at least in that first 60 seconds while we dealt with the bellman.  WRONG.  I’m 6’1”, and I have difficulty working with those high toilets.  My wife was very unhappy.  Her"
995,We arrived early but were allowed to check in. The rooms are a bit small but very comfortable.the lobby was decorated very beautifully for the holidays. We spent a few hours at the martini bar. Our drinks were fabulous as was our attendant. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Our biggest regret was we couldn’t stay longer. We will be back for sure.
996,Flew in for thanksgiving and do touristy things. Couldn’t have asked for a more comfortable stay at the Millenium! The bed was so comfy and the pillows soft! Just what I needed after a busy day walking around Chicago!  Very clean room with plenty of space! Also no noise from outside which was good!  Staff were friendly and helpful!  Would definitely return when visiting Chicago again! 
997,"Just spend the weekend in Chicago and being members of the Millennium Knickerbocker Chicago we were totally unpset withe the service and rudeness of the Staff. We had a show to atttend three miles from the Hotel so stopped by to check in at 3pm which is check in time and was told we could not check in because the rooms were not ready. I told them we dont need the rooms just wanted to check in so we could return later in the evening. Was informed we could not do that. Ok so we wasted 45 min on this trip,, returned later in the evening  to check in and was told we could not have the two rooms with double bed as they were out of them which is what we booked. Next was I told them we have a stay and park which was told we didnt have . After getting all the info back to them was told"
998,"Our room was great. Comfortable, clean, and relaxing. Great bed, shower, and sitting area. We enjoyed the staff, especially Craig the concierge. He was always kind and helpful. The hotel is located in the Golden Mile of Chicago shopping and activity. We were able to walk to various points of interest and enjoy the architecture of Chicago. Highly recommend this hotel.  "
999,"We had a quick overnight at this hotel.  The room was very comfortable and nice, although a little warm (thermostat really didn’t do much to change the room temperature). You can’t beat the location, but parking ended up a little difficult to find.  I wish we would have had more time to explore the hotel and the surrounding area.  "
1000,"Did a pre paid room and decided to upgrade.  Big mistake!  The hotel said $20 a night but fails to convey that they will now double charge you for tax, service and facility fees on the double room ; which you already paid on the pre paid room!  "
1001,"Paid on Cancelon, then asked to pay another $15 per night on top of that fee. Room is dated and small, not really all that great. Booked due to online pictures but I saw nothing that spectacular about the hotel nor the ""facilities"" I didn't use or find any that were of use. Location is nice but you can get that anywhere. Really not worth the price. Parking is also high if you needed it, we used a parking garage elsewhere. Room quality about the same as a Motel 6."
1002,"My daughter booked this for a mother-daughter weekend trip and we throughly enjoyed this wonderful hotel and it’s location. The location is perfect to all the best stores in Chicago, and we were able to walk and shop to our hearts delight! Our double room was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and updated. The bar area offered comfortable and cozy seating with great service and the small restaurant was convenient to grab a quick breakfast before shopping. Will definitely return to this hotel!"
1003,"I stayed here for two nights this past weekend. I highly recommend this hotel for it’s convenience, comfort, economy and fantastic location! It is also upscale and elegant! I’d also like to recognize a special housekeeping employee, Scipien Samba, for her friendly service and detailed attention when cleaning my room and for finding my lost jewelry bag and leaving it for me on the bed with a note! I greatly appreciate her honesty and integrity, and I look forward to staying here when I’m in Chicago!"
1004,Great hotel at a fantastic price! Close to everything with great service. Room is decent size for 2 people with a king bed. Bathroom is good size (toilet hangs on the wall?) Bar on the ground floor as well with projector on the wall broadcasting football games. 
1005,The hotel is centrally located just off the magnificent mile so shopping very close by and nice eating joints. Rooms are a bit shabby and tired with very limited personal supplies. Breakfasts are done fresh although arrive to the table cold.
1006,"We stayed here because of the location but found that the hotel's greatest asset is its staff.  In particular, we apprciated the friendly and kind assistance provided by Craig, the bellman, who helped store our bags and gave helpful suggestions about our stay in Chicago.  We really enjoyed talking with him."
1007,The room was tiny but nice and clean.  The service was great. The room was hot and we could not turn on the AC.  The location  was perfect.  The staff was nice.  We had a great breakfast.  I would not stay there in the summer . ( no ac ) 
1008,"Check in process was tedious. Hotel was just okay. Room was definitely tired. Would rate 3.5 stars if not for incident with valet. Upon check out, a bystander pointed out a large gouge in the wall of my passenger side front tire that caused it to split. The tire was still inflated but was damaged severe enough that it shouldn’t be driven on. Upon bringing it to the attention of valet, they immediately said it must’ve already been like that. The assistant manager came out and talked to valet. After about 10 minutes, he told me that the damage was noted on the valet inspection when I turned in my car the previous night. When asked why I wasn’t notified, he became defensive. Any hotel with a $70 valet should have staff trained enough that if a vehicle is turned in with damage,"
1009,"I stayed at this hotel because it was the venue for a forum I was attending. The forum was conducted on the 14th floor with one hall for the meeting, another for breaks and the corridor in between for registration and table top shows. I give the hotel very good marks on hosting this event.  I didn’t arrive as early as I expected due to flight delay. Still, I made it before the hotel’s official check in time. I appreciated the fact that they found a room for me at that time. Beyond that, the actual check in was far from satisfactory. I will forget it with the hope that this was an isolated happening. The hotel should be able to do better.  The room assigned to me was small but the bed was comfortable. The bathroom, again small, had good amenities including rain shower. Water"
1010,"The rooms were lovely, quiet, clean and had great beds. Located close to the Red line train (easy connection to the Blue line for access to/from O'Hare and bus services to all likely tourist attractions, this is a wonderfully located hotel in a beautiful area. There are most well known stores within easy walking distance as well as access to loads of restaurants, Divvy bikes and the waterside paths.  Ask about the hotel's history and ask to see the Ballroom."
1011,"We held a women’s conference here for 5 days and were very pleased with our choice of hotel. The staff is AMAZING! Our group sales contact, Tiffany, was a joy to work with and the bellhops were terrific. Special shoutout to Nurrie and Craig who were extremely helpful. Although housekeeping staff were very friendly we recommend a bit more attention to details. We had a large suite and it was not fully stocked with supplies upon check in. We did have a few issues with the plumbing in our suite but the engineering staff was quick to fix the issues (thanks engineer Mike) and it in no way affected our stay. This is a historic hotel, so keep that in mind; rooms have been renovated but they are not contemporary in size or decor. Location is amazing; close to the lake and Michigan Ave."
1012,I had contacted hotel prior to going and requested a nice room as we had a double celebration whilst there.  What seemed like a positive reply was received.  On arrival we were allocated a room.  Whilst it was functional it was small and tired.  There was no literature in room about hotel facilities including tv or Wi-Fi. No information had been given at all at check in not even what floor the room was on.   In feed back to Expedia I stated these facts and betel replied that they were ‘mediating direct’ with me.  That was a lie no communication took place at all.   The hotel is in a great location for all amenities and the waterfront. It was disappointing that it was let down.
1013,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August and loved how close it is to Michigan Ave for restaurants and shopping.    It's just a short walk to Rush Street and River North.   The rooms are spacious, the beds are very comfortable, and it's a short walk to the Signature Room for drinks.   Don't miss a chance to see the view from the Signature Room!"
1014,"My stay was good until my room door was left open. I reported it to the manager. I was told I would receive a call at the end of the day to let me know the outcome of the investigation. I did not receive the call, as promised. When I called the next day for a status update, the same General Manager was very rude, unprofessional and did not seem to be concerned with my complaint. He went so far as to ask me “why I was calling back and what was it that I wanted?” He even told me that “I wasn’t getting anything from him,” even though I had not asked for anything other than a status update. When I told him that I was going to write a review and report it to Corp. his response was “write whatever you want.” I’m appalled at the unprofessional and rude behavior exhibited by a Manager."
1015,"Hotel in the northern part of the city centre of Chicago, metro station 10 minutes walking, several bus stops nearby. Rooms quite big and comfortable. Elevators more or less from the last century. Ideally for a city stay for a couple of days."
1016,"I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel 08/23/2019 and checked out 08/27/2019. The hotel was like any other 4⭐️ hotel. It did have a very comfy bed...cool pictures of Chicago scenes in the room and the fridge was VERY well stocked.   I did love the rain shower and the water was very hot to the point that it could get painful, but I love that! So the room experience was good.   What I fell in love with was the history of the hotel! Al and Ralph Capone ran a bar and Speakeasy on the 14th floor! Super cool!!! There was also a secret staircase so if the police arrived, people could escape lol. Love the history! Also I did have a Southside Cocktail at the bar just to have the full experience!   All in all I would absolutely stay at the hotel again. There’s a black bartender"
1017,"This may have been a good hotel in its day, but too many departments are failing for it to considered as a good hotel. Reception was very busy on arrival with one member of staff overwhelmed. Another arrived, but she had a keyboard to attend to, then a conversation with her working colleague, then a phone call, then the keyboard, then another conversation with the working colleague, then her favourite (the keyboard), then “next” the first acknowledgement that there were paying guests waiting. She couldn’t be bothered to pass on information about the WiFi, gym, restaurants, bars or anything. All we got was a key. We then struggled passed the concierge staff with 3 suitcases and 2 rucksacks, but the were enjoying pleasant company with each other. The room was nice though one phone"
1018,"The welcome wasn't so warm and friendly as expecting in this class of hotel. We don't  receive a hearty welcome when we arrived on Friday evening; for example at the reception when we arrived, for the breakfast morrning at the desk when we are waiting a long time for a voucher,  in the dining-room and for the check-out."
1019,"The hotel was really great! I came for a psychology conference and really got to enjoy my stay in Chicago, with the hotel playing a large role. The rooms were recently renovated  (with amazing bathrooms!), whereas the rest of the hotel remains fairly old-timey (in a good way). Ely at the front desk and Alejandro were phenomenal! Alejandro took a number of the guests on a tour where he showed us secret passageways through the hotel! He was super knowledgeable, friendly, and genuine! The hotel is in a safe area to my knowledge with a small convenience store less than a block away. It is fairly close to the train station, too! If you like anything historical or nice hotels, stay here!"
1020,I traveled 7 hours to come here and got the worst service ever from the front desk rep name Jason. He was very rude to the point I decided to check in at the hotel across the street. After leaving I called him to get corporate number and he replied “Google it” I definitely would not recommend this hotel. With them prices I should have got great customer service. What a night.
1021,"Clean, great location and comfortable rooms. Beds are so soft and I had a lovely night sleep!  Very limited contact with staff and the hotel is quiet at the moment so easy to socially distance within the hotel.   Thank you for a lovely stay. "
1022,"I have stayed here on several occasions and each time it’s a hit and a miss, never quite making the mark.  I stay here because my employers booked it and not through personal choice. Each time I have been here there has been issues with wake up calls either for myself or for one of my colleagues. This ranges from not getting a call at all or to the wake up call being 15-20 minutes late. I’m sure the generic management response will give COVID as a reason to this unprofessional service however it has been this way for the last few years.  The reception staff on the desk can vary in how welcoming or blatantly rude they are. I find it rather shocking in a country such as America that is apparently so service driven that from some of the employees at this hotel they can behave in"
1023,In general the hotel is dated. Ceiling Shower Head not working as it should due to limescale  In room safe doesn’t work Shower floor is disgusting I coffee pod it’s what’s left in your room no cream just dairy powder The cleaning is also unifficient and make sure your room door is properly closed as for twice was left open The receptionist on duty on the night of 20/8 was really a charm not providing any further information than saying no I’m sorry   Not good at all
1024,"Was here for business, however in the current situation it was sad not to see all the normal staff at the hotel, especially the amazing doorman. Room was very adequate apart from the iron spitting out dirt on my shirt. Had the problem of only 2 pillows on the bed, this isn't normal and normally have 4 very large ones.  Overall a good stay."
1025,"This hotel has a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The service from the reception staff was polite, but minimal. No info about the hotel was given at check in, no asking if everything was ok as we checked out. The tea and coffee was not replenished each day, neither were the bathroom products. It was a good base for us to explore the city, but we were not bowled over by it."
1026,We arrived in Chicago about 8.30 pm and were really excited for the first leg of our holiday. The doormen took 1 case from the car and left us to move the cases. The receptionists did not greet us with the attitudes we expect from a 4 star hotel and were not forthcoming with any information about the hotel. We were left to our own devices to get to the room. As the title says the room/suite is amazing which is good as it cost quite a lot. There was no complimentary water in the room which is expected normally. We went back down to reception to enquire about breakfast and was told the restaurant was shut. We then asked for a map and the receptionist circled an area of 3/4 blocks and said you are here somewhere. She struggled to pinpoint where we actually were and could not give
1027,"Centrally located near the Magnificent Mile. Shops and restaurants aplenty. Hotel is vintage but not shabby. Sound insulation is the only con as you can hear everything crystal clear from closing doors, to people using the bathroom. Outside street noise can also be quite loud if you're a light sleeper."
1028,"As a business traveller this hotel is one of the worst hotels I have ever came across. The noise is constant from housekeeping and engineer even drilling next door ! Lastly receptionist is beyond rude !  Other staff like bellman are charming ,this hotel really needs to address these issues hence my post as complaining made no difference"
1029,"The hotel location next to Hancock tower and just off Michigan Avenue is great for most tourist and business travelers alike. The bed was very comfortable, but the standard room is cramped. There is 2-3 feet around the bed on all three sides and the desk chair bumps against the bed when you sit down to work. Free wifi is slow (we did not pay the $10 upgrade charge to faster speeds).  The hotel charges a mandatory $15 facility fee per day per room. This is not included in the price listed on booking sites including the hotels own. The facility fee covers business center and gym. The gym is a small room on 2nd floor with no windows with a few running tracks and bar bells. Not worth the $15. I have traveled to 40+ countries and this is first time I have seen a such fee for a"
1030,"We stayed at the Knickerbocker for one night.  Check out wasn’t till noon so we had time to eat breakfast and do the 360 Chicago Observation Deck before checking out.  Location is great.  We walked everywhere.  Went to Millennium Park, Maggiano’s for dinner, Mag Mile.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and centrally located.  Staff very friendly.  Would highly recommend a stay there."
1031,"The knickerbocker was a complete disappointment. I booked 7 nights for a family vacation. Upon checking in we were informed that there was NO Pool. (Although it is listed as one of the amenities. Complete false advertisement and the front desk was not slightly surprised as “it happens frequently” “Not all of the pictures online is of this property, we get that a lot!” Giving the benefit of the doubt we looked at the room. It was completely outdated and smelled of mold. We proceeded back to the front desk and asked if we could get a refund and check out to go find a new hotel. Keep in mind the full 7 nights were charged in FULL the day prior to arrival (although on line it stated it would not be charged until check in.) The front desk manager agreed to a full refund, and"
1032,"Needed a good night's sleep after a big day in the Windy City.  We got it at the Knickerbocker.  The room was updated, bed comfortable, and bathroom clean.  Priceline provided a reasonable cost for what we were looking for.  Would stay there again."
1033,"We have just returned from Chicago and had the pleasure of staying in this hotel. The hotel is in a great location and is within walking distance of museums, shopping, restaurants, the beach and other touristy interests. All of the hotel staff were amazing and could not have been more helpful. We were very lucky to have our room upgraded as we were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary. The hotel staff even provided a bottle of bubbly and chocolate covered strawberries which were gorgeous and completely unexpected. We would definitely return to this hotel without hesitation and hope to do so next year!! Do not hesitate...book this hotel!! You will not regret it!!"
1034,"When I booked the Knickerbocker I was not expecting a valet parking fee of $69 per night! I can forgive this as parking is expensive in general in downtown Chicago. A small problem we had was, the hotel restaurant was closed when we got back around 10.30pm one night and the staff said they could not heat up our 1-year-old's pre-cooked meal. The room was very comfy and the space was satisfactory considering the location of the hotel. The restaurant staff (when it's actually open) are extremely friendly and wonderful to talk to. A good hotel, but the extra expenses can add up and you'd end up paying a hundred or so more dollars than you signed up for."
1035,"The bed was so big and the shower was THE BEST. We had a standard king room. I wish valet or parking was included in the stay but it was $69 which ends up being cheaper than some overnight parking in Chicago. Overall, the price was great and the rooms were so nice we will continue to stay here in the future. We had an issue where we warned valet that we would be leaving at 4 am and they said we could still valet. They told us they were bringing our car around and then 20 minutes later they asked us if we were asking for our car. we waited 40 minutes for our car because the concierge said valet was working when they had not even begun to work yet. not the valet's fault but don't lie to your customer's front desk."
1036,"I am currently spending my second night at this hotel.  Came her for a wedding.  Checked in Friday, no soap.  Called front desk. No way to call housekeeping.  Took many, many rings before someone answered.  This was true most of the times I called.  Someone came up with one bar of soap. Was I supposed to take it back and forth from sink to shower? Called about charge to my Visa.  Put on hold.  After about 7 minutes, I called from my cell.  5 minutes later, cell was answered, while I was still on hold on the hotel phone.  Front desk understaffed.  Trip advisor checks that there is a concierge.  Not true.  No concierge.  Next am I went to make coffee.  No cup.  Told Candice , manager, Got me a coffee.  Room not made up by 1 pm.  When it was made up.  No towels. No soap. No coffee"
1037,"One of the nicer hotel experiences I have ever had.  Great, attentive staff.  After a rather horrible travel experience to Chicago they were terrifically accommodating (and calming) upon arrival.  Very clean rooms.  Can't beat the location.  Great bar in the lobby."
1038,"This was our 3rd stay at the hotel, and while we started out a bit rocky (issue with our reservation), the hotel manager, Clarice, was more than welcoming and helpful to assist.  As I was searching for our reservation confirmation, Clarice worked diligently to rectify the issue on her end and all ended perfectly well.  We no longer felt anxious and concerned about our hotel stay and enjoyed a wonderful week's stay in Chicago.  Additionally, the breakfasts and servers were top notch, as were the bar folks.  We will definitely stay at the Knickerbocker when we plan our next Chicago visit!"
1039,"An hotel with old fashioned charm and in a good location, but it is very badly in need of a refurb.   The reception and lobby area needs new carpeting and a general upgrade. It has a very run down feel.  The bed was comfortable and clean but the room was more than a little shabby; bathroom floor tiles cracked, scuffed walls and badly frayed carpet which was just this side of being a trip hazard. If I’d been staying longer I would have asked for a different room.  The food in Nix was fine but an incredibly slow service. I sat for 15 minutes after being given the breakfast menu before anyone took an order.  Overall I was very disappointed with my stay."
1040,"My wife and I, along with our two kids came to stay at the Hotel Monaco in downtown Chicago recently. The hotel is perfectly situation along the Chicago River, an easy walk to the Navy Pier, and so many other downtown attractions. The room was spectacular with the little sitting windows. Our kids would wake up each morning and hang out in those nooks! The customer service, from the people at the front desk, to the General Manager Adam Gurgiolo were superior. We could not have asked for nicer people to interact with at this hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago if they are looking for outstanding customer service, a luxury property and views to die for!!"
1041,"Booked 3 nights, because I needed a break from my work.  We weren’t sure what to expect due to the pandemic.  We were greeted by Gretchen, who couldn’t have been any nicer.  Maybe the nicest person on planet earth. She gave us a run down of the hotel and what to expect in the city.  Our room was very very clean!  As a hotel Rooms Director,  trust me I can find things that’s wrong in a hotel room. The place was beyond spotless!!! Back to Gretchen, while my husband park the car down the street we chatted and she greeted/acknowledge every  guests that come and go through the front door.    Fast forward to the next few days. We would come and go 5 times a day through the lobby and majority of times we said hello first and when we didn’t we got no acknowledgement. It is true,  your"
1042,"Alexandra was a queen: check in top notch. She was understanding of my personal struggles upon check in. She gave me the top floor, complimentary toiletry gifts, and the comfort and hospitality was top notch. This hotel should be 5 stars just for her service.  I will certainly return in the near future. Thank you all for making this a memorable stay. I have yet to receive better service."
1043,The idea of perfect customer service is Abdul Albow at the front desk. Extremely professional and helpful! Great job guys! Room was extremely clean. Anything that we needed Abdul took care of it. Check in was extremely fast with no hiccups. I parked at a garage right down the street for the weekend that was within walking distance and reasonable prices.
1044,"I was a little nervous about traveling during the pandemic, but Gretchen Mitz made it all worthwhile. Not only was she warm, friendly, and welcoming..but had answers to ever question asked. PLEASE......make sure she is rewarded in some form. She truly goes above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you Gretchen for making my stay....MEMORABLE."
1045,"My friends and I planned a dinner and show in the city. We chose to stay at hotel Monaco. We could not have been more pleased. When we arrived they had a complementary wine hour in the lobby. While enjoying some wine, I noticed the hotel offered a bicycle if needed and dog bowls for your pet to grab a drink. The staff was so welcoming and accommodating. We were able to stay in a beautiful room with a view of the river. We were a few blocks away from the theater with great restaurants near by for dinner. After the show we headed back to the hotel for a drink at the  hotel bar. The bar tenderer was very personable and great to talk with. We had a great night. The Monaco staff and ambience makes this hotel a place I would love to visit again soon!"
1046,"I have been to Chicago many times, but this visit sincerely was beyond belief! Gretchen greeted me and immediately I knew this would be my best visit to Chicago!   I have stayed at about every hotel in this city, but never have I received a welcome like this.Not only me, but others in the lobby were all about Gretchen we wll! She is an outstanding ambassador for Chicago and the entire Kimpton chain. I truly appreciate her and her outstanding customer service. "
1047,This hotel enjoys a great location and it is nearby the Magnificent Mile and the Millennium Park. The reception staff is great and super helpful! They made me feel welcome and assisted me with my hotel needs. I would definitely recommend this quaint and classy hotel. I just hope they get me into higher floor next time around!
1048,Stayed overnight at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Chicago on March 7th. I was in town with a childhood friend who had never been to Chicago. Gwen at the front desk made sure that his first trip to Chi-Town was memorable. We stayed on the 11th floor with a river view and a window seat big enough to sleep on. The room was very clean and spacious. The doorman and bellhop were very friendly and courteous. I’m definitely looking forward to bringing the Mrs. back for her birthday in a few weeks.
1049,"Stayed at the Hotel Monaco for Leap Day weekend.  Location was perfect, walking distance to Miracle Mile, Navy Peer and  Millennium Park.  Hotel has a nice little bar with drinks my date loved, very foo-foo.  Should be able to book on Priceline for $80-$150/night."
1050,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 nights as part of my birthday/wedding anniversary weekend. I had indicated my check in time and the occasion for my visit. Check-in was smooth and as soon as I opened the room I was definitely wowed (if that's even a word)!   Very artsy decor in the room, comfortable bed and lots of instagrammable locations in the room and bathroom. Throughout my stay, I occasionally received text messages from the hotel asking how things were going. This was a nice touch.  In terms of improvements, here are some recommendations I have- - Don't just provide complimentary tea and coffee downstairs for customers. Add some fruit or a few cookies. This will add an extra touch to the hospitality.  - Provide a non-alcholic beverage option during the complimentary"
1051,Centrally located in the Loop. Walking distance to great restaurants and shopping. Terrific coffee and tea served in the lobby to start your day and wine hour starting at 5 to end the day-a perfect combination.
1052,"The staff made the stay so special!  They were friendly and so happy to serve their guests. Staff went above and beyond...when I realized I had forgotten my coat in my car that the valet had parked the day before, they went to get it for me and had it to me within minutes. Ate at the restaurant once and it was great. Location is super close to theaters, restaurants and shopping. Room is spacious and decorated beautifully. I could occasionally hear street noise (honking) and floor noises from next room but couldn’t hear TV or conversations. For the most part, very quiet. Definitely a great value. Highly recommend! "
1053,"This was our second time staying at Kimpton Hotel Monaco in Chicago and it has yet to disappoint! The staff is always so professional and friendly. Although we didn’t travel with a pet, I was very impressed with how dog-friendly they were. They even had a water and treat bowl out in the lobby for all of their four-legged guests. We stayed in a king deluxe room with the river view (totally worth the extra money). My FAVORITE part about this hotel is the little nook you get in your window in your room. Since we had a river view room, I was able to lounge in that nook and just watch the city (great way to end the night). Other than our awesome nook, the room was clean and very modern. I also utilized their fitness center, which has weights, ellipticals, treadmills, and a PELOTON!"
1054,"We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago and none have been this clean and with great staff! We were greeted right outside our Uber and everyone from him to the front desk, to the person who brought our luggage to our room were exceptional!   We came for my daughters 21st birthday and received an upgrade with a great view and window seat. Nothing beats the window seat!  This is the only hotel we will be staying at from now on!!!!! Great location to everything!  Thank you!"
1055,Were in Chicago for three days.  The location is in the theater district and within walking distance of the Art Institute can't be beat.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and steered us to some excellent places to eat and to enjoy live music and drinks.
1056,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Chicago for a night while in the city with my nephew, and we enjoyed a beautiful one-bedroom suite.  The room was clean, very well maintained, and had plenty of space--the comfy seating along the windows was even a nice touch.  Hotel staff was super friendly and casual (in a good way).  Location in the Loop was excellent--close by just about everything, including the train lines.  I'll definitely be back to stay here again."
1057,"I really liked the hotel. great rooms, great decor, staff is friendly. great  restaurent downstairs adjacent to the Hotel for breakfast. Same thing for the restaurent, great decor,  staff is nice and helpful. My only negative, I was walking from about a mile where I had dinner with customers. Passed in front of it  a few times looking for the Kimpton hotel. It doesn't say Kimpton hotel at the front. weird!!I guess they just joined ..not sure."
1058,"We absolutely loved staying here! Not only it’s conveniently located in the heart of downtown, but the staff is friendly, and the rates are reasonable. The eclectic decor is fabulous!! The fact that it’s dog friendly is only the icing on the cake. This will be our go to place whenever we visit Chicago! Can’t recommend it enough!  "
1059,"We came to Chicago to explore the city center, and what an amazing experience we had at this property!  The entrance was humble, in comparison to some of the other properties in the area, and the lobby was cozy and inviting.  Alexandra and Eric checked us in. Each was engaging and delightful. Our room was upgraded to a Corner King 1BR suite on the sixth floor, and we couldn't have asked for a better room.  The only thing lacking was a bathtub.  The view was spectacular, looking out onto the Chicago river, and I immediately found myself relaxing on the window seats, (which were at several of the windows), taking in the sights.  Fruit, sparkling wine, and water were placed in our room while we attended the wine hour, a nice surprise.  The carpeting and color of the hallways and"
1060,Wow! Is all I can say. This hotel was amazing in every way. I cannot wait to plan another trip back to Chicago and stay at the Kimpton. From check-in to check-out we were treated special. I mentioned to the young gentleman checking us in that this is a late birthday celebration and he immediately asked what wine I preferred and brought a bottle up! The swanky decorations in our room and throughout the hotel were a major added bonus to the stay. Fresh fruit infused water available at all times of day and coffee and wide selection of tea in the mornings. Due to our time constraints and itinerary we didn’t get to participate in the nightly happy hour with wine they have every evening. I even called the front desk to ask if they had a better blow dryer and one was delivered to my
1061,"The Monaco Chicago used to have a wonderful upscale bohemian ambiance. The lobby was exceptional, different seating options, art, bar where guests could work... it was welcoming, and a great place to meet and greet, or enjoy the social hour. The rooms were similarly decorated... Recently, the hotel has been redecorated.. they have lost the feel of the Kimpton Monaco.. the lobby is basic, more similar to chain hotels, and the rooms have lost character and furniture such as  the modern couches and reading chairs, not to mention the animal print robes, blankets for window seats.. those small touches that made it such an exceptional place.  The service at the hotel continues to be excellent, and the location is great,... just sad to see it lose so much of what made it a destination"
1062,"We typically spend a weekend in Chicago during the holidays to take in the lights, shop downtown, visit the Kindlemarket and maybe see a show.  It had been probably 20 years since we last stayed at the Monaco, and we were pleasantly surprised.  Newly remodeled, it was extremely comfortable and inviting.  Staff was wonderful, and we both loved the fact that we did not have to check out until noon."
1063,"One of the friendliest hotel staffs in Chicago!  Excellent location, amazing service and dog friendly like all of the Kimpton properties.  LOVE this place, especially for the people who work here!  Close to everything, 1/2 block from Michigan Avenue."
1064,"I don’t write many reviews but feel obligated to share a wonderful experience. I honestly cannot think of a complaint. Perfect central location, very clean, quiet. Walking distance to theaters, the bean, navy pier and magnificent mile. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Though I did not partake the complimentary wine happy hour was a nice option. I had my children with me and they loved the window sitting areas. They pulled the curtains and had their own private “nests” with WiFi and an amazing view of the river and trump tower. They even slept in the windows several nights (sounds odd but they’re about 6’x3’ with a nice mattress pad and pillows). Not sure when or if I’ll be back to Chicago but if I do I will definitely stay here."
1065,"Our 3rd stay at Hotel Monaco!...my daughter and I come to Chicago every other year...magic the first time and magic this time...early check-in and room ready...LOVE the new room decor...view of the river...the “L” and Sears Tower...lovely!!!...spotless room!...comfy bed and fabulous bath!...beverage service every morning in the lobby...My very best to Antonio...and to the entire staff at Fisk and Co. with a shout out to Samantha, Amir and Paul....thank you all for making us feel at home while in Chicago...see you again in 2021! Happy Thanksgiving 🦃"
1066,"Every time I stay at a Kimpton I enjoy myself immensely.  This was no exception.  The hotel was beautiful, cozy, and happy.  The location was great, too!  Just one turn off from the window.  Opt for a river view!  It was great sitting in the window frame looking out over the city.  The only unfortunate part is that the Trump Hotel is in sight."
1067,"Had to stay an extra night in Chicago due to the weather and moved from another hotel to this one due to overbooking.  The Kimpton was one I was not familiar with but the one bedroom suite I had was very spacious, clean and was conveniently located."
1068,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco in connection with a business meeting held at the hotel.  Check in was a breeze.  The lobby is really nice with a lot of sitting places.  My room and bathroom were very nice.  The one drawback is no coffee maker in the room.  You can get tea and coffee just off the lobby even in your bath robe.  Breakfast is served at the Fisk & Co. restaurant in the hotel with limited, but adequate choices.  The meeting room was very quiet and set up to our satisfaction.  We had a very good lunch served by buffet in our meeting space.  The attendant was  attuned to our needs.  The Monaco is just across the bridge from Michigan Avenue's miracle mile."
1069,"This was my first visit at the Hotel Monaco, and it is by far my new favorite hotel in Chicago! First, the team there is outstanding! Front desk Alexandra, Samantha, Eric, Gwen and Ronald-awesome! Bellmen, Dion and Conner so great, and Laura and Lorraine kept our room beautiful!!  Second, the Fisk-restaurant delicious! Great staff lead by Amanda and Payton our server. Third-the Hotel is BEAUTIFUL!! Loved the Art Deco feeling-but modern!! Last-LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! We walked everywhere with ease! Convenient to just about everywhere we went! We will be back!! Awesome team and hotel!!"
1070,I stayed here for a meeting and what a great place. Conveniently located to all downtown shopping and eating. Everyday morning tea and coffee and evening wine. The rooms are spacious and quirky. The beds are comfortable. I’d definitely stay here again 
1071,"We had an awesome experience and the customer service level is beyond expectations. Caroline at check in & out was awesome.. she had a cab prepared for us although we didnt need it. Great conversations. The front desk was awesome and the housekeeper who cleaned our room Saturday night was great! Although we didnt interact in person, we interacted through notes!. The restaurant had great food and the staff was super friendly and attentive."
1072,"We stayed three nights at the hotel. The staff was at your beckoned call. Antonio, Joshua & Sonya took great care to make sure all our needs were provided, The wine & hors d'oeuvres in the afternoon provided a nice time to relax after a day of adventure. The hotel is centrally located making it easy to walk around, catch ""Hop on-Hop off"" bus and the boat tour. Also close easy walk along the river trail. I would recommend this hotel for cleanness, service and location."
1073,"I only stayed at the Monaco for a night, but would definitely stay here again.   The king room I stayed in, which I think is one of their base rooms, was gorgeous, modern, and clean. The furnishings were some of the most beautiful I have seen in a hotel.   It was a decent size room, but the window was super small. Not sure if all the base rooms are like that, but it wasn’t a deal breaker for us, especially for one night. Also, try and get a higher floor. We were on 4, and could hear a lot going on down on the street below.   This place is walkable to everything, would definitely stay here again. "
1074,"Had a great night at the Kimpton.  I’d like to thank, Dion and Alexandra at the front.  They were very friendly and made both check in and check out a breeze.  I’d also like to thank the staff for the excellent recommendations for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The location is perfectly located for the best of the Riverwalk and Big Bus tours.  The attached restaurant was very good as well."
1075,"We used credit card points to book this hotel over Labor Day weekend and chose a Suite style 2 room layout.  Wow, were we pleased.  The room was on a corner, with awesome views of the Chicago river and city hustle and bustle.  The rooms window ledges were so wide and long that my 6' 4"" son and 5' 9"" daughter both napped or just stretched out to read during day and evening time in the room.  Dad got pats on back from kids and wife that I reserved the ""best room ever.""  That never happens, cause I tend to go more budget.....but splurging on this room was worth it.  I also enjoyed the free cruiser bike rental and rode miles up and down the lakeshore drive bike paths.  Fun!"
1076,First time in Chicago ! The team at the Monaco made us feel like at home! Everyone is so caring and nice they all had great  recommendations of were to go and what to do. specially the bellman Antonio he is a gem! He has been with the hotel for over 20 years...so pleasant to talk to he always has a smile in his face. Everyone in the Front office team is amazing! Abdul the Front office manager is great ! Kudos to the housekeeping  team the rooms apart from being beautiful they are spotless clean! 
1077,"A beautiful boutique hotel, in a superb downtown location.  Coffee in the lobby is the best. I would have given it 5 stars, but upon returning home, found we had been charged for a bottle of wine from the fridge.  We took our own wine and beer. I called hotel and they had the charge reversed.  "
1078,"I love the Kimpton Hotels and chose to stay at the Monaco in Chicago last fall. Although it is right in the center of everything downtown, it is very quiet. The room is typical Kimpton Monaco with two plush beds, a lovely reading chair, small bathroom (due to this being a refurbished hotel). Bonus was the window seat which gave me an excellent view of the Trump Towers and the Christian Science Reading Room.   The hotel is only two blocks away from the wharf to catch the architecture boat tour. They have a bike you can borrow if you want to bike along the river.  The service is of course five stars. I used the concierge service to book my tour and to find a restaurant for dinner. As I was on business, I stayed only one night, but I was able to leave my bags at the front desk so I"
1079,"Quaint hotel in an awesome location. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and our room was great. Spacious with comfortable beds. Despite overlooking a decently busy street, noise was not an issue."
1080,"Stayed here for business and a fantastic hotel.  Great staff, very helpful, rooms very comfortable, good choice of breakfasts and right in the heart of shopping and restaurants.   No request was too much and even though they don’t have a business centre they helped with any request I had swiftly and helpfully."
1081,"This hotel exceeded my expectations. I was on the 8th floor, which looked remodeled. The hallway was so unusual and pretty. My room was large and beautifully decorated with blue and yellow. The bathroom was large and had a lovely marble sink, tub with overhead hand held showers, and stylish chrome grab bars.  The free coffee in the lobby was a nice touch. Fitness room was a good size. I liked the alternative 80s and 90s music in the elevator and lobby!"
1082,"The rooms are so unique, window seats, large bathroom. We came to chicago for a little getaway for a friends bday and there was plenty of room for all 4 of us. The staff are incredible, Jonathan, Ron and Gabe helped make our friends birthday so special. They are amazing. Thank you guys so much. Also the bartender in the am was very helpful with giving things to do, and her drink making skills.... mmm"
1083,I Loved the room. You can tell this hotel has been recently updated and upgraded. Comfortable window seats were a great place to relax and enjoy the city views.  Nightly wine night provided a unexpected and enjoyed start to the evening. 
1084,Great staff and  location.  There is construction going.on outside but I did not hear any noise from it. I had a great upgraded corner room.  The exercise room was good.  The bar area and wine reception are a reason to stay here alone
1085,"The wifi would not stay connected during our entire stay, which was very frustrating, but overshadowed by the poor service and lack of follow up by the hotel staff regarding the issue.  Per their guidance, on our first day I contacted the support number and they were able to verify that they were having issues with the WAP and/or repeater in our area of the hotel (top floor) but would get it fixed.  As the issue was not being resolved, I contacted the front desk one to two times per day during our 4 days there.  They apologized, offered free cocktails, asked us to move rooms (on our final day), but never actually followed up on anything, proactively contacted me, or drove it to resolution.  There was no ownership of the problem, just me asking over and over if it was fixed. "
1086,"Ron, who I believe manages the front desk, checked us in and we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to an amazing room with awesome window seats and views of the river. This hotel is in a great location in downtown Chicago and the staff are the best. The hotel is newly renovated in a perfectly boutique fashion. Excellent food and cocktails, very comfortable bed, awesome bathrooms. Stay here!"
1087,"Chicago was our first stop on our American holiday and we couldn't have stayed in a better hotel. We arrived quite tired after a long flight. The doorman and reception desk were friendly and helpful. The room wasn't particularly large but was well planned with sufficient storage, amenities, USB plugs and most importantly a good sized bathroom. The location is central which means you can walk to many of the sights, take the L further afield or short taxi rides which weren't expensive. Walking distance to Andy's Jazz Café and around the corner from the Witt - hotel with a lounge on the 23rd floor - not the highest view point in Chicago - but a pleasant place to have a drink. The restaurant at the hotel had decent food and good choice of seafood and getting breakfast was easy. They"
1088,"My husband and I booked this hotel for a last minute weekend trip to Chicago. We knew relatively little about the hotel when we booked it but we liked the location and price.   We were blown away by our experience! The staff were so incredibly polite and accommodating and the rooms were just beautiful. We had a lot of things planned in the short time we were there and it was so relaxing to come back to our room at the end of each night to unwind. I especially appreciated the pump bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash - there was more than enough to take care of my thick hair for the weekend!   We would absolutely stay here again on our next trip to the city. "
1089,Accompanied my wife who was on a business trip to Chicago.  We have stayed here before and always is a pleasure.  Their complimentary wine hour is a bit hit with the guests.  The person pouring the wine is always generous with his pours.  Some light finger foods are also served.
1090,"Spent three nights at the Kimpton Monaco over Labor Day weekend. From check in to check out, service was superb. Antonio and the other members of the valet team were consistent, friendly, and considerate.  Interactions with the front desk team were also very pleasant and they were able to help with every request I had. The servers and bartender at the hotel restaurant, Fisk and Co., had the same warm and service oriented attitude.  Absolutely loved the riverview room I had. From the furnishings to the bathroom, it was thoughtfully furnished and a delight to come back to every day after a long day out. The Frette bathrobe and bedding also hit the spot; the Frette linens are one of the details that I love about the Kimpton brand.   The location can't be beat if you want to be in"
1091,"Another great stay at the Monaco last week.  This hotel, and Kimpton in general, are always well worthwhile!  I'd like to try the Grey or Palomar, but usually stay here because of the location.  Friendly staff, comfortable beds, decor that is NOT cookie cutter, fun social hour with wine in the late afternoon.  Will return!"
1092,"We just got home from a 3 night stay.  We had a spacious and beautifully decorated corner suite.  From the moment we arrived the staff was warm and welcoming.  This hotel has the best location. It’s in the theater district, close to magnificent mile for shopping and just a block away from the trains for a short ride to any of the sport stadiums.  We ate one meal at their restaurant, Fisk and Co. Everyone in our party had something different and it was all delicious. Their front desk staff was friendly and helpful by booking us our river boat tour, making dinner reservations and sharing some info about sights we’d enjoy.  We will definitely stay here again. "
1093,"IHG Spire.  Business trip in Chicago.  Hotel staff was amazing and was great from check-in to check-out.  Attached restaurant, Fisk and Co, could use some improvement.  The food was great, but the service was lacking.    Pros: - Recently updated - Great location - Hotel staff, including the doorman, is really great - Rooms are very clean  Cons: - Had to remind waitstaff that I ordered a drink twice and had to flag them down to get my check.  This was during a late lunch at around 2PM and I was one of four people in the restaurant. They were nice, but spacey or occupied by other things.   Regardless of restaurant experience, I would definitely come back again."
1094,"Our stay at Hotel Monaco was wonderful!  The hotel is decorated beautifully, from the lobby to the guest rooms and guest bathrooms.  Everyone was so friendly and attentive.  It was a pleasant experience from check-in to check-out.  "
1095,"Stayed at the Kimpton Monaco on business for one night in August. Everything was ideal. Great location right in the center of Chicago. Shopping and the Mag Mile a short walk to the North, The Financial and Theater District a short walk to the South, and the stunning Millenium Park a short walk to the East.  Check in was a breeze, I was in my room five minutes after walking through the door. Room was huge (#702) with a large bank of windows, a nice privacy screen, adequate desk, a huge TV, and an honor bar/fridge. The bed was very comfortable with top quality linens and pillows. The spotless marble bath was well appointed with a step in tub/shower, nicely sized sink/vanity, and a very cool looking mirror. The bath does employ large pump bottles for shampoo and body wash, not an"
1096,"Very Nice Corner Suite on 6th Floor (611) With Nice corner view on Chicago River. Room was clean and well equiped. Separate sitting and bedroom. Plenty space and quite, only hear Some fire trucks. Reception people are friendly and helpful everyday happy hour in the lobby with Nice red & White wines. In house restaurant Fisk & Co  , Belgium brasserie is open for breakfast and lunch & dinner Very friendly conciërge  If you want to stay Down Town Chicago I would highly recommend this hotel!"
1097,"I only spent one night. I first have to say that every staff person I dealt with was super friendly and very helpful. My problem was noise factor and I suppose that can be mitigated if you choose the right room.  I was first assigned a room on the river side that was too close to the hotel’s outside air conditioning unit that bothered me the moment I stepped inside. The manager moved me to a “quieter room” upon my request, which was located on the city side overlooking an alley outside the hotel. It was quiet (and the room is very nice, bed comfortable, etc.) until 2 AM when for some reason a large garbage truck came by to empty every huge metal trash container (there were about 7 or 8 of them) in the alley, clanking, dropping, backing up beeping, and creating noise that I was"
1098,"This is a really nice boutique hotel in a great location by the river. But what's really standout, first-rate about this hotel is its staff. I am a seasoned traveler, both here and abroad. We interacted with  Antonio, Jonathon, Gwen, Ronald, Alexandria, and Selwyn during our stay and they were all so friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to anticipate our needs. For example, as sat in our car ready to leave the area to head home, Johnathon noticed the delay in our departure and offered to help with directions. His route to the airport was clearer and more helpful  than those on our GPS! Antonio recognized us every time we walked past the hotel on our way somewhere else, and greeted us like old friends. He had great suggestions for places to visit near the hotel. He"
1099,"The hotel is really nice but the staff are world class, friendly, helpful and just a joy to be around.  Antonio, Jonathon, Gwen, Ronald, Alexandria, and Selwyn all made us feel at home and welcome.  They really pulled out all the stops when they located and returned to us safely the electronics and jewelry that we had left in the safe in our hotel room..and shipped it directly to our home in Switzerland. Such integrity and service!  We have stayed in several nice hotels in Chicago but this one is now top of our list and we can't wait to return to see our new friends."
1100,"Unbelievable service from the moment you get there to the moment you leave, specifically from Antonio, truly a gem who makes your stay welcoming.  Hotel and rooms were beautiful and clean. Stayed in a suite and loved the seated windows to view the city.  The room and view made me not want to leave for the event I came for just to stay in. Will be staying again!"
1101,Excellent Customer Service!! The entire staff is really great. So friendly and smiling like they are truly happy to see you.  A plus is that the hotel is BEAUTIFUL!  The rooms are so comfortable and very clean.  The only place I’ll ever stay in Chicago.  
1102,Fantastic customer service. Very nice and clean hotel. Great location. Within walking distance of almost everything. Phenomenal bar downstairs. Very accommodating. Only downside is that the bed and pillows weren’t overly comfortable but the rest of the experience more than made up for it!
1103,We throughly enjoyed our stay here and we were sad we were only staying one night! The location was phenomenal as well as the view from our room. Our kids loved the window seats so much those chose to sleep there instead of the bed. We also had a chance during wine time to chat with Eric who is part of their “manager in training” program and he was incredibly personable and so friendly! He will certainly be an asset to the Kimpton Family! Thank you for a great night in Chicago:) 
1104,This Hotel is our favorite in Chicago.  The staff are friendly and very accomodating.  You will love the fact that the hotel is completely remodeled.  They have a free evening wine reception and morning freshly brewed coffee in the lobby or they will put a Keurig in your room free of charge.  It centrally located near the theater district.  Awesome price and service! 
1105,"Overall, a good hotel. We were on the 10th floor, but had zero view (I didn't pay to upgrade to a good view). We just kept the blinds closed. :) I liked that there was a deep shelf along the window- it made a good spot to leave our open suitcases for easy access. (we tend to live out of our suitcases and don't use the dressers). The room was a good size, had a desk, bed was comfortable, no complaints. The ice machine was right across the hall, and they provided glasses for drinks. (actual glass, not plastic) They provided nice smelling shampoo, conditioner, and soap in big dispensers in the shower. Bathrobes in the closet, and a yoga mat. They even brought me up a razor and shaving cream (free of charge) within minutes of me texting them. Oh- yes, they texted me as soon as I"
1106,"A large group of us stayed in the Kimpton Hotel Monaco for a girls weekend and had an AMAZING experience! The hotel is in an ideal location, right next to the river and easy to access many things in the city from! Our group was big so we booked a suite and a conjoining room and it was perfect! The bathrooms are great in this hotel and the rooms have very cool window seats/beds. The rooms were spotless!! So clean and decorated very nicely. You feel like your in more of a small family owned hotel - very boutique! They had a complimentary wine hour and coffee and fruit infused water throughout the day. The best part of this experience was the staff! Everyone was so kind and helpful throughout our stay. Especially the manager, Alex Hayes! She was so eager to help us and went the"
1107,"I had a very enjoyable five-night stay in this hotel. The staff, from the front desk to the doormen to the facilities workers were friendly and hospitable. The hotel itself is beautiful. I like that the rooms were configured differently than most hotels, and they feature huge TVs--60 inches I think. How awesome is that?  The location is great. I walked to the RiverWalk, to the double-decker bus stop 1, to Millennium Park, to the Magnificent Mile, to the theater district. There are great places to eat nearby--there's even a Chick-Fil-A a close by. The hotel downstairs, Fisk & Co. is a pretty good seafood place (but i ordered a cheese burger).  There's free coffee in the lobby every morning--even iced coffee. And at night there's free wine. One night there was free ceviche!   And"
1108,"When we travel, we always try to stay at a Kimpton Hotel. So, on our trip to Chicago, we booked the Hotel Monaco. On the positive side: - The room was beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable, etc. Perfect. No complaints. - The hotel is centrally located...easy to walk to many sights and restaurants. - The hotel staff was nice. We had two problems: - First, there is no concierge and the people at the desk were not very helpful in giving us restaurant or sightseeing suggestions/information. We asked several times for suggestions and finally gave up. - Second, throughout the 5 night stay, housekeeping did not leave enough towels, wash cloths, body lotion, etc. At one point, upon leaving in the morning, we left a message with the front desk that we needed body lotion. Upon our"
1109,"I generally like Kimpton hotels and for my stay this was no exception (except for the annoying texts from the front desk checking that I was ok--that's superfluous!).  But I managed to rush out in the morning and leave a nice pair of pants and brand new shorts in the closet. I didn't discover this until that evening, when I was in New Jersey looking for the pants to wear the next day.   I was in Chicago, near the hotel, all day. If they had called me to let me know that they found them, it would be have been a breeze for me to come by and get them. Instead I had to call twice to track them down. On the 2nd call they said that would send them to me and took down my home address.   The next day I got an email from a 3rd party service (Lokated) offering to send them to me for $22"
1110,"I stayed 2 nights in this hotel in June and I totally recommend it. Here is a quick story about my stay and how things that start bad can end up being corrected and making a customer satisfied again.  First time, I did not have a very good start when I arrived in the hotel (8am on a Sunday). I knew I was early for check in (I arrived from a 11 hour flight) but the issue was more on how the staff treated me on my early arrival. I did not liked it and made a complaint.   The positive thing is that after i left, I received the customer feedback email and I made my fair customer complaint, and I was immediately responded by the Front Officer Mgr, Mr.Abdul, whom gave me huge support for my upcoming stay and of course, apologized for the situation I faced in my arrival.    I just have"
1111,"My family traveled to Chicago for an extended July 4th holiday and stayed at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco. We enjoyed a wonderful hotel experience. The entire staff is friendly, courteous and professional. The entire hotel has been recently remodeled and all areas are in superb condition. The location of the hotel provides great access to the Chicago river and area restaurants and shopping. "
1112,I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and traveled with my two dogs for their first visit to Chicago. From the moment we pulled up to the moment we departed; we made to feel extremely welcome. They remembered our names each time we cam in the door and my dogs were very welcomed. We would all stay again in a heart beat. Thank you so much to all of the staff for a wonderful stay.
1113,"I would stay here again. However, I'd do so with a more cautious approach. Here's the good, the not-so-good, and tips for staying here:  Good: Coffee service in the morning – outstanding, high-quality coffee! Room service was very good (although I do wonder how a bottle of water out of the mini bar vanished that we then got questioned about during checkout). Location is exceptional! Eric and Michael at the front door were the nicest humans you could ever hope to meet. Love that dogs can stay here. Also, the beds are amazing.   Needs Improvement: Travelzoo vouchers. We had issues using ours. We were charged the full price of our room. Fortunately, within a few days I was refunded my money. I'm happy with how promptly the front desk corrected the mistake, but hopefully that"
1114,One of my favorite boutique hotels in Chicago. The location is perfect right off the Chicago River and just a few blocks from Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park. Also walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago which is a must see.   The lobby and the rooms have been recently remodeled and look great. Wine hour in the lobby from 5 to 6 always works as a nice way to start a fun evening.   The people at Monaco are very helpful and friendly. If you go make sure to talk with the doorman Peter. He has been there over 20 years and will take great care of you. He always had great suggestions and is just a great guy. Get a coupon from him for the Irish bar right across the street.   My girlfriend and I had a great weekend at the Monaco.
1115,"Excellent location for mid-Michigan Avenue access and to the theaters to the south. Was crowded over the weekend, but the staff were incredibly gracious and kind. Happy hour was a okay, good wine, very little food, but that is not what I was there for!"
1116,Stayed overnight after the Rolling Stones show.  Service at check in and out was great. Room was clean and nicely appointed. It was a nice luxury boutique hotel.  Comfy bed and nice towels. Quiet.  It really was a great room for a great price. 
1117,"I have booked a one night stay at this hotel in May for my mom and my son, as a graduation present for my son. Hotel is absolutely amazing, and went above and beyond to make their stay special. We have requested higher floor, and hotel was able to accommodate it. The front desk lady (either Gail or Gwen?) was super helpful, and was able to accommodate our request for a room with 2 beds, with nicer view. The room was spacious, clean, very quiet, had a very nice river view, and very pleasant decor. Hotel lobby offers nightly happy hour, which was a very nice bonus. They had a dinner and breakfast at Fisk &Co, and were extremely happy with food and service. Hotel is very conveniently located--about 20 min stroll from the Civic Opera House, and about 20 min pleasant stroll to The"
1118,"Just stayed one night for nearby meeting and overall the room was very good.  Spacious with nice clean bathroom and a room safe.  Loved the soap and shampoo dispensing bottles vs the disposable tiny bottles that end up in landfill or worse. Only 2 things I noticed that made my sleep less than perfect.  There was a a musty smell on the wall with the window, which was very noticeable when sleeping on the side closest to the window.  I could not find any signs of leaking or water damage, so it might be behind the wall. The other thing was the constant outdoor fan noise coming from the 4th floor roof of the structure under my window.  I was on the 7th floor so I can't imagine how much louder it gets for the lower floors. Other than that, great location and nice looking property."
1119,"If you find yourself needing to travel to Chicago, and want a boutique hotel that is conveneient,  contemporary,  and where they know your name, and care, consider the Monaco. The rates are steep, but the rooms are spacious and recently redone."
1120,"Recently stayed here during the corona-virus pandemic- this hotel is located almost directly on the miracle mile.  They hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Valet parking is pricey here, $76.00 a night but I believe you can book packages to include it, which we didn't.  While I like the location of this hotel and the staff, the rooms have seen better days- with all the hotels in Chicago, we most likely will not return.  We did enjoy our stay, we just want to see what else Chicago has to offer in the future."
1121,"Outstanding value, amenities, staff, attentiveness, and more! Perfect location, easy to get around, and smiles at every turn. The 676 bar is a great spot to get a cocktail or glass of wine while you watch the city wind down its day, and the fitness center is very nicely appointed with plenty of options and extras! And you're steps away from the massive Starbucks jewel just south of the Omni (if that's your thing - it's certainly mine!)."
1122,Fitness room not real well equipped..some equipment including Pelletron  Nice room service staff..decent food. Nice suites. One bottle water for being high level select guest. Omnis are consistant in quality for sure. 
1123,The staff and valet were extremely courteous. Clean room with great view. Housekeeping was quick and friendly. Great location. My daughter and I had a Sunday appointment we had to leave for at 1pm and we were able to get a late checkout without a problem. We arrived Saturday for shopping and sightseeing and the location was great!
1124,"The service at this hotel is outstanding.  Probably the fastest check-in process we have ever experienced.  Room service staff were amazing as were everyone else we encountered. Obviously, great location as well.  Now for everything else.  The hotel is somewhat dated.  Construction seems mediocre at best, as things were falling apart in the room and some of the components seemed very cheap. We had a corner suite and had two major problems with it.  First, expect your room to be very LOUD if you are on Michigan Ave.  The windows did nothing to temper the noise.  Second, the ""living room"" area is too small if you are using the pull out bed.  If you are on the side of the bed opposite the door, you will either have to climb over the bed or walk through the bedroom and then the"
1125,"Excellent hotel - professional and courteous staff throughout, quick to provide anything asked for (microwave, towels, etc.) and just very pleasant people.  Very clean and up to date rooms and common areas.  Pool was perfect for little kids (not super big, so can get crowded), was a little confusing to get to (through workout room (super nice!) and womens/mens locker rooms).  Location was fantastic to everything we needed (steps from Michigan Ave, close to Water Tower) and very, very kid friendly.  Purchased a package with parking included which did save a significant amount of money for the valet."
1126,We visited for just a quick trip to see family friends. Rooms were smaller but nicely set up bathrooms we typical hotel size. We had I believe a hospitality suite with a table for six so we could entertain friends. We had a great stay and wonderful hospitality like we do at most Omni properties. They have a great selection of food (room service is available) and were accommodating to our allergy kid.  It was a great deal for the price.
1127,"Booked a corner suite for January 4-5. They had a completely different name for my confirmation number which causes problems at check in. Finally get checked in and go up to the suite and the room was dirty, black out curtains stained, bedsheets stained. Shower drain clogged, called twice to get it fixed and both times nothing happened. Also paid for a late checkout, and had people knock 3-5 times on our door to see when we were leaving. That started at noon. Paid a lot of money for very underwhelming product. Luckily the location was good so my wife and I didn’t have to spend as much time as we would’ve hoped to in the hotel room. Overall very disappointed. Tried to contact people about the experience, never got a phone call or email back. So I guess add poor customer service"
1128,"The rooms look lovely online, but are in fact VERY small and cramped. Just seems like it needs a refurb-the thermostat didn't work, shower didn't drain, hallways reeked of weed, and walls were paper-thin to the point where conversations next door and in the hallway were very clearly audible. Although the service was excellent and staff went above and beyond, I could not recommend this hotel. Location was the main perk. "
1129,"This is a very nice hotel, located in the heart of some amazing shopping (upscale) also located near great sights i.e. Navy Pier, Water Tower, museums, movie theaters etc...Hotel has decent amenties too, this hotel is worth the price"
1130,"Services; From Valet, to check in, restaurant, to the nice lady that fixed my cook to order omelet breakfast was excellent. They even brought up to our room champagne & chocolate covered strawberries for our 40th Anniversary.  We ordered room service 1 night and that was really good. There is a new Starbucks 1 block away that has 4 floors to it.... huge.  Our room was clean and decorated nice. We were on the 25th floor (highest floor), very quite.  If you want to people watch on Michigan Avenue, I would recommend  between the 6th-15th floor."
1131,"We were on a 3 generation trip and rented two rooms. The grandparents had previously stayed here and enjoyed it. Prior to arrival we requested rooms near each other and a crib for our almost 2 year old. They took care of both. The suite set up was perfect for us. The hotel is nice but not too pretentious for traveling with kids. Great location to walk and see everything. Before vacations I’m always searching reviews to find places that accommodate both adults and kids, and it’s not always easy to get info. Highly recommend this place if traveling with baby, toddler, or kids!"
1132,"Business meetings, room seemed to be newly renovated but in fact it had been a few years. speaks to the level of cleanliness and maintenance the room are held to. Good outlet and charging support at the desk. the night stand could use outlet ports but was able to work around that. Had a question on HVAC it was so quiet you could not hear it running told the front desk and before I could get back up to my room maintenance was there Anthony very sharp articulate answered all my questions exceptional employee AC was fine that’s just the way it worked."
1133,"Our family of 4 (kids ages 5 and 6) stayed at the  Omni Chicago for the first time and we loved it.   The moment we walked in the entry we were greeted by staff who warmly welcomed us and gave my daughters a small drawstring bag that contained activities, coupons, and a squishy toy. We were directed to the 3rd floor to check in.   We arrived almost three hours before check-in and planned to drop our bags off and enjoy the city for a while. Much to our surprise, a room was ready and we were able to check in. The front desk staff member signed us up for their free rewards program. He knew we were heading to the American Girl store and discreetly asked me if I’d like to add the American Girl package to our stay (includes a bed and robe for the doll). I said yes.   We headed up to"
1134,"I would not recommend friends or family to stay here.  Especially if you have someone in your party that may partake in medical or recreational marijuana.  With out any warning my friends were kicked out of the Omni Chicago at 8:00 am for suspecting them for smoking marijuana and charged a $500 clean up fee.  This was ridiculous on how the situation was handled.  To kick out paying tourist without any warning is a horrible way to do business.  Management on duty was incompetent and believed we were warned by the staff when we were locked out of our room the previous night.  That was not the case, when I came down to get the keys fixed I talked to the receptionist on duty and specifically asked why we were locked out.  She said, “It may have been caused by having your room key"
1135,"Stayed at the Omni hotel on Michigan Ave this past weekend and was not disappointed!  All staff (from bell persons, front desk, housekeeping etc) were very friendly and quick to greet guest while coming/going.  Room was large and very clean.  Concierge staff made great suggestions for restaurants and places to go.  Would highly recommend this hotel and plan to come back when in Chicago again."
1136,"Loved the location, easy to walk to many attractions, restaurants and shopping. Also convenient for Uber pickup and drop off. Front desk staff was superb. Friendly and competent. No lines for check-in and check-out--yay!  Baggage check made us a little nervous when we we checked four bags and only received one claim ticket. When we called for our bags, they told us we should have had four tickets and took luggage descriptions assuring us they would try their best to find our luggage. But alas, not to worry, a very polite and gracious bellman arrived at our door within minutes with all the correct bags. The room was beautiful and clean. Loved the suite setup with a separate sitting area and second TV to help avoid viewing disagreements.  This was a great find on our first trip to"
1137,"Nice hotel near Michigan Ave shops.  Valet and front desk staff provided great service and even changed our room to give our family of 5 a little more space.  Pool and hot tub are very small for the size of the hotel, and valet parking is pretty pricey.  A little noisy overnight from the occasional sirens, but great hotel overall.  "
1138,"We’ve stayed at the Omni before which is what enticed is to come back. The front desk was great and helped us promptly. Once we got to our room everything seemed great until we started checking out the bathroom. We had to call about our bathroom not being clean. There was a huge chunk of hair stuck to the shower wall. And I don’t mean a strand or two, more like someone ripped out their hair and stuck it to the wall. Something hard to miss if they actually cleaned our room before us coming in they would have seen. There was also ripped up paper bits from the soap box in the shower. But they came to clean it while we went to dinner. Dinner at 676 was great. In the next couple days of our stay we had to call house keeping a couple of times to service our room. I always put the card"
1139,"Absolutely fabulous hospitality, suites and amenities.  The location is also perfect in the heart of the Mag Mile and very family friendly.  The wonderful loyalty program is a must to enroll in as well with unbeatable perks.  A special thank you to all the staff that made our stay so amazing!!   "
1140,"Great hotel, staff very helpful and attentive,rooms great size and comfortable,all amenities you need coffee machine great too, restaurant very relaxing and friendly.  Going back in a month for another visit, cant wait. X"
1141,The employees were very friendly. We were lucky to be able to check in to our rooms very early. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the rooms and by how nice they were for the price! I would definitely recommend staying here while you're in Chicago. Great location!
1142,"If you'r going to spend a Christmas weekend, for me, this is the place to go. If your a walker, most places can be gotten to by walking, the Art Museum is a nice mile walk, if not, there are cab's everywhere. I find the staff here to be outstanding. I've been coming here for ten years now, at Christmas, and I'm known the minute I step from the cab. I get value for my dollar here, and as long as I have a dollar to spend, I'll spend it here at Christmas,"
1143,"I always stay at Omni when visiting Chicago.  The team at this location really understands the value of great customer service.  From the time you are greeted at the door to the time you leave, the entire staff go above and beyond to meet all of your needs.  The hotel is clean, is in a great location, and the staff is top notch. If you need anything, just call the front desk and they will address it very quickly."
1144,This hotel is in a great location to everything in Chicago. The rooms are large and good for a family travelling.  The breakfast was delicious and the waiters and chefs were very helpful and accommodating. The beds are comfortable after a long day walking out in the cold 
1145,"We have come to Chicago every year for the past three years and stayed at the Omni.  Can’t say enough good things about their friendly staff from bellman, front desk, restaurant & bar employees to housekeeping.  Also their fitness facility has been so convenient and enjoyable for a good workout. Always love coming here❤️✈️"
1146,"This hotel was so beautifully remodeled.  The staff, especially Ramsey was awesome and the Sky bar gets a 5 from me! Please take the time to visit if your in the Chicago area. You will be pleased with your stay and the cleanliness of the rooms."
1147,"I stay here every time I travel for work in Chicago. The suites are all amazing and the customer service is great.  If you're part of their loyalty program, you get a lot of nice perks, which are all free. Easy to get work done and also rest. Home away from home while I'm working."
1148,Our suite had no heat which was a major problem in November.  Our family froze.  We informed the front desk after first sleepless night but it was never fixed.  Second night was equally cold and sleepless.  
1149,"Perfection I cannot begin to emphasize how great our stay at the Omni Chicago  was. The hotel is  perfectly situated right on Michigan Ave in the center of it all!!! Steps from the Hancock building and the sweeping views of the Gold Coast Shoreline from the signature room.  This hotel is beautiful and warm and comfortable and inviting  We were welcomed and felt so at home in the spacious suites  The staff too many to thank including Adrian, Michelle, Jorge and Victor were all wonderful in  676 on the 4 th floor Adrian creates wonderful handcrafted cocktails and is incredibly personable even at their busiest times.  The bell men at the front door were always welcoming us back and the front desk staff Laurence and Josh are so helpful. The management here are out and checking on"
1150,My review of this fabulous hotel is under one of the pictures I was very lengthy it is a wonderful experience at the Omni.  I have so much to say about this gorgeous hotel the incredible staff especially Lei in Housekeeping and Josh D and Laurence who are both outstanding experts at guest relations at your front desk.  The Omni Mag Mile was a great experience and we had a perfect stay everyone on your staff seems to be exemplary.  Can’t wait to visit again .... thank you all so much  Perfection!!!!
1151,"The Omni Suites is such a wonderful hotel in the most amazing location on Michigan Avenue. The Omni is  close to everything and yet this hotel remains a tranquil refuge  Just steps from the hustle and bustle  I don’t even know where to start....the hotel itself is beautiful with large comfortable rooms and exquisite attention to detail.  The staff here is amazing unfailingly polite and hospitable we had such outstanding service from Lei with Housekeeping, And we had the best assistance from both Josh D at the front desk who checked us in and greeted  us, assisted us in finding a late evening spot for dinner and made sure we were settled in  thank you Josh for your help so grateful for your assistance,  Laurence  also at the front desk  went above and beyond to merge multiple"
1152,"The best Omni I've stayed at.  We'll be back!  The gentlemen at the door service were helpful and friendly.  Before I arrived, Justin, my ambassador reached out to make sure the week went well.  The location is excellent, walking distance to Lookingglass theater and many popular places.  I was working and it was close to the Booth School campus - my destination each day.  Hot coffee at my door each morning - a great hotel in a great city."
1153,"Another great experience at Omni Chicago.  Annual getaway that never disappoints.  They are top notch!  Great service always by bell staff, front desk, and housekeeping.  Medina, Crystal and Cassandra are outstanding.  They keep us coming back every year.  "
1154,We stayed one night and caught up with friends from CA. Needless to say it was very expensive and the charge for the garage for having a car is over the top expensive. I get there is no parking but jeez  way to much money.
1155,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Omni. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. The location on the MM was perfect. Lots of fun walking. The room was large, a suite, and very nice and comfortable and clean. I would certainly stay there again. "
1156,"The location, facility, staff and little extras make this hotel a gem. Highly recommend it. The loyalty even on the second visit is terrific. This property made us feel appreciated and would make it our first choice when visiting Chicago. "
1157,We always look for Omni Hotels when traveling because of the excellent service and lovely rooms. We especially like the coffee service delivered in the AM for loyalty members. The Chicago and Indianapolis locations are among our favorites. 
1158,"A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff within walking distance to all the sights and restaurants. Rooms were spacious, bed was comfortable (and clean!), bathrooms well equipped and also clean. The staff (especially the doormen and bellhops were very kind and helpful when looking for recommendations. "
1159,"A recent business trip to Chicago resulted in a stay at the Omni Hotel.  Excellent location off Michigan Avenue - walking distance to several shops and restaurants.  Good size room, great natural light and modern setting.  No issues with internet which is essential for a successful business trip.  The staff was helpful and friendly.   "
1160,"The location of this hotel is fantastic.  So much to do and see that is in walking distance, and most importantly felt safe.  Also if you get tired of walking or want to get further out the taxi's and Uber's were quick and easy to get especially thanks to the doormen.  The staff were all friendly and helpful, and in my opinion make the hotel great.  The rooms were clean, nice and comfortable. Will definitely recommend and stay again."
1161,"Great hotel in a great location. Right in the middle of everything, all in walking distance. All of the staff were so helpful and friendly. The rooms were so big for a city centre hotel. Nice leisure club too with a pool. "
1162,"Omni Chicago has great service and safe hotel, the food was good room service was timely. Great Location was to shopping .The rooms were alittle tiredall rooms are suites and large , and bathroom wasn’t that clean. Overall a great stay but for the price would probably look at another selection of hotels."
1163,We usually stay at the Trump while in Chicago and I wish I would have . The Omni is old and dark and dreary . The room was clean but not charming at all - seemed outdated - staff was just so-so. We asked for water and never did get any. Nothing in the room that would be considered a great amenity except coffee . For the price of the room andnehat the Omni offers I would rather spend my hard earned dollars at the most luxurious hotel in Chicago ....the Trump
1164,"The single problem I experienced, and it was a significant one, was how noisy my corner room was facing Michigan Avenue. Sirens kept me awake all night both nights, because the room has virtually no soundproofing. I genuinely don’t know where the rooms on the other side of the hotel are as noisy as mine was."
1165,"We just stayed at the Omni Chicago for a family event. Arriving in a pouring rain storm, we were greeted and offered a towel to dry off. Even though we had an umbrella!  Check in took less than two minutes. Our suite was perfect. The sitting area large enough for six people to relax. The large well appointed bathroom was clean and the hair dryer came in handy to dry wet jeans.  We ate in the bar and our dinner and service was outstanding.  This will be our go to spot in Chicago."
1166,"I stayed at the Omni for one night recently while in Chicago on business.  It is very well located for shopping, restaurants, and museums.    Even though I travel on a government rate (which is not generous), I was put in a suite with a large living room, a huge bathroom, and a comfortable bedroom.  It was very comfortable, quiet, and clean.    The front desk staff was friendly, efficient, and accommodating.    The rooms do look a little outdated, but honestly that didn't matter to me.  I felt very much at home in the hotel, and have reserved a room for me there for another upcoming trip to NY in a few days.  I would gladly continue to stay there for both business and personal travel."
1167,"I stayed here for an extended weekend with a friend for my birthday.  We both loved it.  We order room service, and it was delicious.  We also used the spa services, massages in our room.  They were lovely.  The hotel is a great location.  The room was clean.  The beds were super comfy. The door men and desk attendants are very friendly and helpful with everything we needed.  Our only complaint ( If its even a complaint) was when we ordered a wine opened, it was very cheap.  It did not work well.  I would definitely recommend this hotel! "
1168,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago downtown, The staff went out of their way to make me feel well and comfortable. The bar staff was exceptional as well, with great cocktail selections. I would definitely stay here again."
1169,"   Spent 2 nights here.....the first night we were too tired to go out to eat so we had dinner in the restaurant.....dinner was very good.....expensive but good......we had the parking and breakfast buffet included in the price of the room which in my opinion is the way to go.....otherwise I think parking is around $72. Per day and  the breakfast buffet is around $32. Per person......the rooms are like mini suites.....really nice!.....safe, Keurig coffee maker and 2 TV’s .......the thing I didn’t understand is the TV in the bedroom was mounted to the left of the bed... no  swivel and you can’t pull it out ....so, it was difficult to watch....it might seem trivial, but it bothered me!...another thing that didn’t bother me but bothered my wife is that there is not a door to the"
1170,Staff is friendly and professional.  We were greeted from check in to check out.  Restaurant generally has a little bit of everything for every taste. Rooms (suites) are comfortable and relaxing. Good choice of hotel to stay at.
1171, We stayed here with our two-year-old to celebrate my husband‘s 40th birthday and everything was superb from start to finish!  The room was ideal for our family and the service was exceptional.   The extra touches that were done for my husband‘s 40th birthday as well as for my son was very impressive!  
1172,"If you want location, a spacious room, superb staff and wonderful accommodations, stay at the Omni Chicago.  We just returned and I can’t say enough. The staff was extremely professional. Nothing was ever a problem. From the dining staff, front desk, concierge ,to the bell staff, I was extremely impressed. Now let’s talk about the room. Every room is a suite , so plenty of room to spread out. There was a king bedroom and a small living room with a little wet bar and refrigerator and sink. Certainly spacious enough for two or more people. The location bordering Michigan Avenue was outstanding. I walked everywhere and felt so safe .   I can’t wait to return and I hope to make the Omni my choice again and again . I am glad I am a Select Guest member, as well."
1173,"Enjoyed a 14th floor corner suite with wonderful views of the surrounding city.  There was a living room with sofa, desk, tv and adjacent kitchenette (sink, dorm fridge, coffee maker).  Separate bedroom with bath that adjoins both the bedroom and living room.  Did not hear the street noise below!  Did not hear noise from any other room or the hallway ... wow!  Super convenient location along the Miracle Mile.  Very friendly service, easy check-in and check-out (just drop your keys in the box at the elevator and they'll email you a receipt).  Very good stay."
1174,"This is my first time at the Omni and I love it. The Omni is a medium size hotel and has  a good feel to it. My room was very impressive, nicely designed and decorated. They have great customer service, emailing before I arrived and even afterwards to make sure everything was ok. I have been to many 4 star and some 5 star hotels as well but this is now one of my favorites.   Can’t wait to bring my wife next time. "
1175,"Our first time in Chicago- So glad to have found this hotel.  Safe, clean and convenient to everything (walking distance to most attractions) Staff was great on every level. I can't say enough about them- super friendly and knowledgeable.  Our room was clean, well cared for and I felt safe leaving things behind.    The only two complaints I have is: 1) the couch in the one room suite was extremely uncomfortable.  We were supposed to have a sofa bed- which we wound up not needing, so we never brought the issue up, but the regular couch was not good for much-too small for two people to watch TV comfortably and other than an desk chair,  there were no other chairs in the room. The second minor complaint is that out mattress seemed to be nearing the end of its life span (as were the"
1176,"I have been to swanky 5 star hotels before where they say “customer service is our number one priority” but they do not hold a candle to the Omni Hotel - Chicago.   KINDNESS IS IN THEIR DNA!!! This was my family and my first time with this chain but I will honestly pay extra just to stay here next time... it was THAT GOOD! The hotel staff are like I’ve never experienced before in my life.   What makes them unique:   1. Reservationist on phone who was so patient when I took too long making up mind about room size, breakfast package, etc.  She even took a note down that we’re celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary and we were greeted to our own bottle of champagne and personalized cake when we arrived!  2. Bellmen who helped our kids out of their Ubers joking with them every"
1177, This was our second visit to Ommi. Rates were reasonable. Very satisfied. Staff is very pleasant and offers assistance at every turn. Room was clean and inviting. Concierge was very helpful with questions. 
1178,"We were looking to replace one of our go-to hotels that is no more (The James).  There are so many choices downtown and it's hard to make a decision.  We have a 5-year-old so we wanted to go someplace central to downtown, has a pool, and had a larger room, the Omni checked all these boxes.  The Omni Chicago Hotel is in the perfect location right off Michigan Ave across from Disney Store (Just for reference, but also a plus).  The staff at the Omni is really what sets it apart, everyone was so nice.  The doorman/valet staff where all the best I have ever dealt with, Marham spificially was soooo great.  Our Room was large and clean.  We will be coming back to the Omni for sure."
1179,"If you are planning a trip to the chicago area, think again about booking at the omni chicago.  While i know that all hotels have issues, it is how the hotel handles those issues with its guests that makes the difference.    We stayed last week at the omni from Tuesday - Saturday this past week.  We arrived around midnight on Tuesday evening and in the morning, there was no hot water in the bathroom.   I called the front desk at 7:15 am and they stated it was an individual room issue and someone would be sent up to look at it.  By 8:30 am, no one had arrived and we left the hotel at 8:30 unshowered because of our schedule.    It should be noted that maintenance was already in our room at 1:00 am, since the drain in the only sink in the bathroom was locked in the close position. "
1180,"A wonderful facility right on Michigan Ave in downtown Chicago. The valet staff are absolutely wonderful ( the cost, however is ridiculous.) Check-in was effortless, and the room was just as depicted. Dont miss the balconies off of the pool/ fitness area!!! Close to all the action!"
1181,"From the doorman and bell hops to the front desk - everyone was extremely polite and helpful. The doorman helped me locate an open parking lot to park our car, which had a travel shell mounted on the top and prevented us from parking in the hotel garage. The front desk gave my kids little goodie bags and water on arrival which was very unexpected and excellent first impression."
1182,I was beyond impressed with this hotel & their staff. They were so welcoming to my daughters & I from the minute I arrived to the minute we left. They were friendly & more than helpful on every occasion. I honestly haven’t experienced hospitality like this in quite some time. The American Girl package was quite a deal & my girls were treated as if they were special guests. They loved every minute of their stay here. I would highly recommend this hotel & will definitely be returning. 
1183,"This is my new favorite hotel in Chicago, and I have stayed in about a half dozen so far. The location is perfect for walking to just about anywhere in the downtown area. All the staff I interacted with were very friendly. The rooms were well kept and perfectly comfortable.The real highlight was the breakfast buffet. It was a bit pricey for what was included, and I was disappointed it didn't include french toast everyday because it was really good, but it was absolutely delicious. We looked forward to it every morning. A few minor quibbles I had that kept it from being a five star review: *The rooms are described as suites, but they are about the same size as any standard hotel room. That was perfectly comfortable for me and my boyfriend's needs, but squeezing more than two"
1184,"Family of 5 & we had a spacious room (two doubles with pullout) on the top floor!!  Unfortunately, we had no view, but still had a great stay.  Didn't know about Omni kids club- so we were surprised for the gift & milk & cookies.  Beds were comfortable, fridge was helpful.  Two TVs.  All awesome.  Fitness room was very nice, pool is indoor & quite small - my kids were still very happy with it & the hot tub.  Staff was all friendly.  I would highly recommend the Omni, especially if traveling with family.  "
1185,"Our suite was large, living room, bedroom and small bathroom.  Wish we had room above the 8th floor the view would have been better.  Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable.  Cleanliness in public areas could be be better. Hotel bar service was very good.  Breakfast buffet was good.  The biggest complaint was the elevator wait.  Good location if you want to be in upper Michigan Ave."
1186,"We just spent 5 nights at this great Omni location on the corner of N. Michigan Ave. and Huron St. The location couldn’t be better: close to the Riverwalk ( boat tours) the Hancock Center ( views!) and of course the Michigan Ave shopping. A fun and vibrant area. The staff is exceptional . Melissa, the Concierge, was extremely pleasant and helpful. She gave some great restaurant choices which fit just what we were looking for. She recommended a jazz supper club (Andy’s) where we could go with our 17-year old guitarist son. We had a great time there thanks to Melissa’s recommendation. She also helped us with the best modes of transit to get to the colleges we were visiting, as this was part of the reason for our stay. She is an asset to the hotel. The room accommodations were very"
1187,"Very pleased to stay at this hotel on our first trip to Chicago.  It is near great shopping, sites of interest and wonderful restaurants.  You get great value for your money.  All rooms are suites and are well appointed.  It’s hard to find a bed that we find truly comfortable but we were delighted with the bed comfort in our room.  Not sure if all rooms have this feature, but we had windows that offered views in several directions. "
1188,"Omni Chicago The Good Beautiful Hotel located right near the Magnificent Mile.  The rooms were good size, very clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff was wonderful, especially the valet guys who were always there to help you with a friendly smile. I don’t think my hand ever touched a door handle. The moment I approached the door one of them was there opening it for me. Lots of great places to eat, drink or shop nearby. Parking is $72.00 a night.  So many things are close by and there is a great public transportation as well as Uber, Lyft and cabs, you really don’t need a car if your visit is to the city. Very impressive workout area, check out the garden boxes outside, chock full of leafy green vegetables, as well as the seating if you want to take in some sun on a nice"
1189,The hotel is beautiful with stunning views of the city located by all the shopping. The staff was beyond amazing! We had a couple of things broken in the room (toilet seat and light) that were fixed right away. 
1190,"We had a wonderful two night stay at the Omni.  The King Suite was very comfortable and the customer service was wonderful.  We really enjoyed breakfast.  I was partial to the french toast, while my husband enjoyed the light fluffly waffle made to order.  It is situated perfectly between attactions on Michigan Avenue (close to Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales, Macy's, American Girl, etc.).  Would definitely stay again without hesitation."
1191,"The attention to detail coupled with the customer service makes this a fabulous experience!  The staff is superior, the late afternoon lemonade and tasty pastries were perfect on a hot Summer day. The pool and gym facilities were spotless. Room service was very quick and wonderful.  The bedding in my room was delicious and made it hard to get out of bed.  Omni Hotels never disappoint!"
1192,The location of the hotel was great! The rooms are very nice and spacious. Most of the staff was very friendly. For people wanting to stay by Michigan Ave I would definitely recommend this hotel. Especially for those that want spacious rooms.
1193,"The staff in the hotel were excellent from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out. The restaurant is contemporary and the food was quite good. Room service was the same, and service was prompt and with a smile. We had a great room - a junior suite - on the 20th floor (Room 2002). The room is updated and in excellent condition. The only detractor is the room feels as though it is not insulated for sound at all. I have stayed in 10 other hotels in Chicago, and also traveled many times to other major cities (NYC, Washington DC, Atlanta, London, Paris, San Francisco, Seattle). Though we were on the 20th floor, the sound level from car horns, sirens, car radios, etc., would have made you think you were staying no higher than the 5th floor. Sadly, this was a big"
1194,"Upon arrival at the Omni Hotel Chicago with my wife and two friends, I was told the manager wanted to speak with me.  I had requested by telephone while en route to the hotel that my guest bag be prepared as a gift to the local firemen, as my friend's son is stationed a the local firehouse.  I assumed the manager had prepared a special gift for the local firemen, and was happy my request had been honored.  Much to my amazement, two ""managers"" pulled me to the corner of the reception area, and started by saying, ""If you're not happy here, we'll cancel your reservation, and  you don't have to stay here.""  WHAT?!?!?!  They proceeded to tell me that I had made a racial statement to the person who had spoken with me on the phone,  "" asked what they thought had happened, and they told"
1195,"The location is great in the magnificent mile,close  resturants ,supermarket and Chicago CTA Station. The Bad thing in this hotel. 1-Not luxury like Other Omni like in LA and Washington Dc. 2-No Spa in the hotel. 3-I am Member in Omni Hotel  and when I booked by expeida the send I will be Vip  customer.But,they did not give me free bottle of water  everyday or free drink or cake like other Omni hotels .Also,the Premium  is prepaid while suppose to be free.  The postive in this hotel : 1-Great view  from my view. 2-welcome and Freindly staff. 3-very clean Hotel. 4-qucik check in and check out. 5-Helpful  concierge. 6-cool room. 7-I had a parking included package .   I stayed 7 days  from 16-23 July  2019 and my room was 2518."
1196,"We stayed here two nights and enjoyed it.  The bellmen and front desk are nice and helpful.  We had a parking included package and that was nice.  The lobby is on the third floor and the only hangup is that you have to take an elevator to the third floor and transfer to the room level elevators.  Being OMNI gold we were given drink comps for any drink in the bar and that was a nice lagniappe.  We were in a corner king on the 18th floor and there were windows but behind the bed was a structure that kept us form being able to see Michigan Avenue, which was down bellow us.  The room had a safe and was a suite, which was nice.  There were TV's in both rooms.  I know that they had a pool and workout room on the 5th floor which were nice.The restaurant and bar are on the 4th floor and"
1197,"Very good service from all hotel staff.  Nice room at reasonable price. Convenient pool for kids since the it 3 foot deep everywhere.  However, bathroom issues required 2 calls to front desk which has been annoying."
1198,"No early check in, no perks, no hotel car, and no spa. Only the bell staff made this trip enjoyable-they were wonderful! Doorman is excellent, knowledgeable of area offerings, and very attentive. Offered me a bottle of water on arrival, as well as while waiting for ride."
1199,"Hmmm, I was excited to stay here while on a business trip. I stayed for 3 night. I had higher expectations but I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms. The space and modern bathroom was the only plus. Otherwise, the rooms looked dated. The paint was chipped here and there. I found stains on the walls. A popcorn and plastic from candy wrapper on the floor that was there before I arrived. There was a brown stain on the toilet that I had to ask housekeeping to come clean 2x and it wasn’t thoroughly gone until my last day. Being pregnant, I didn’t want to be exposed to diarrhea or some sort of virus while using the bathroom. The housekeeper was nice but didn’t not totally get the stain out with her little spray bottle. Then she wiped the toilet down with a rag and"
1200,"A Grand Hotel in Chicago  Before October, I had never stayed at the Palmer House - a Hilton Hotel at 17 East Monroe St, between S Wabash and S State Streets, in Chicago’s Loop, but my wife had. She was there for meetings, several years ago, and had been unimpressed by the room, to which she was assigned, even being a Hilton HHonors Diamond member for over a decade. The tiny room stuck in her mind, so when she informed me that she had meetings there, I made sure to book a suite, even though we are now “Diamond for Life.”  We arrived from O’Hare, just as her first meeting was to begin, so I checked us in, and was offered a Diamond upgrade, and accepted that. We had Suite 20150, and it was quite nice, and spacious, though with a bit of an odd floor plan. My check-in was very"
1201,"The Palmer House is beautiful. It is a classic hotel and the longest continuously operating hotel in North America.  We almost didn't stay there based on reviews. It is old.  If you expect open, airy contemporary hotel, this is not for you. The rooms and bathrooms are smaller, but they are decorated in style. It is centrally located to theaters and restaurants.  We saw a play, went to dinner and then went to the hotel bar, Potter's, to welcome the new year  (they do not host a new year's party).  Even though the bar in the hotel didn't officially stay open past midnight, we stayed past 1am on New Year's eve and the staff continued to provide friendly service.  I would definitely stay there again."
1202,"The old world charm of Palmer drive, its central location and Hiltons tested customer service made this stay a perfect win! The building is showing some age in the rooms side, but the lively lobby and the great restaurant and breakfast (free for diamond members) is an amazing deal in Chicago city. Absolute value for money! "
1203,"Great location, beautiful hotel.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful.  The room was large and clean.  Check in and out was a breeze.  The location of the hotel is excellent, close to shops, restaurants, park."
1204,"We stayed at Palmer House close to Christmas .  It was a wonderful experience.  The very magnificent lobby was further enhanced by a huge, beautifully decorated Christmas tree.  The atmosphere in the lobby was celebratory with families and couples enjoying drinks and refreshments.  They accept dogs, so our little schnauzer was welcome as part of the family.  We had dinner in their restaurant, Lockwoods, which was not cheap, but convenient.  The room was not spectacular, but comfortable and the halls had portraits of all the entertainers who had preformed there over the years.  The hotel is within walking distance of many sights and the park.   While the stay was not cheap, it was a lovely experience and very memorable"
1205,"We stayed for two nights over St. Patrick's Day weekend. The city was very quiet, and the hotel was also. The staffer at registration booked us into a perfectly fine but pretty ordinary room. The chance came up to ask about a transfer to one of the more unique rooms -- there are many in this hotel -- and like that, it was done. Lobby bar was peaceful for a really pleasant winding down after long walks around the city and at the lake. I did not get the names of the people on staff who so professionally helped us switch rooms -- but if management happens to read this, they were working late morning on Saturday, March 16 -- and they made the difference between a four-star and a five-star review."
1206,"So don’t get me wrong the lobby and the interior of the ground floor is beautiful and definitely has the wow factor. But you don’t have to stay there to see or experience it!  We stayed here as part of my husbands 50th birthday and it was a big disappointment. Check in was a drag and a bit of a mess. When we eventually got up to our room, which was a trek to walk around and find on the floor, it was huge. Bed was huge, seating area, tv, walk in closet - but the bathroom was rather small compared. The shower was quiet pathetic and there was no side space to put anything in the bathroom. There was no coffee or tea making kits in the room either - which was shocking. I had very uncomfortable nights sleeps too, although bed was huge very lumpy. Also got woken up at 7.30am one"
1207,"This hotel was very clean and has a lot of character.  Location is great.  Amenities are great for the cost.  My room was near the train which I could hear as I fell asleep, but it didn't bother me.  Very comfortable, and friendly staff.  Highly recommend."
1208,"We were very pleasantly surprised by how stylish and old fashioned (in a good way)  the Palmer House seemed when we first walked in. Genuinely welcoming staff ushered us in and directed us to the check in desk and as the full splendour of the lobby ceiling rose up before us we were taken aback by the grand glamour of the place. Desk staff were professional and efficient, our room was well oppointed and the bed was a generous size and very comfortable. Linen, towels and bathrobes were all fresh and perfectly laundered. All in all we had a very pleasant stay and the hotel was how you imagine hotels used to be so we were very pleasantly surprised to find that some still are and at a very fair price."
1209,"This is a very long review, but I wanted to warn others because this is by far the worst hotel staff we’ve ever experienced. We should have listened to all of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor. The feeling of being in an upscale hotel ends the second that you talk to an employee. If you have any problems during your stay, DO NOT expect to have it taken care of without an attitude.   The employee attitudes started well before we even arrived at The Palmer House. We had reservations for the weekend before St. Patrick’s Day, which is normally a very busy weekend in Chicago, but with the outbreak of the Coronavirus the city postponed the parades and dyeing of the river. After this news, I called the hotel on Wednesday to see if they would be waiving the cancellation fee or"
1210,"Great building, the rooms are ok. The views are a bit limited, but great stay and very close to everything in downtown. The pool was closed, So we couldn’t try it. Great breakfast selection, but would be pricy if it wouldn’t be included. "
1211,We love this iconic Chicago hotel and have seen its transformation over the decades and applaud its success. The best way to start any evening is drinks in the palatial lobby area that atmosphere a festiveness and history is truly special. And our room was quiet - that truly matters! 
1212,"First problem was that I booked this hotel because according to Hilton's web site it had an executive lounge.  It does not they've closed the lounge.  So I guess the lounge is now a part of the hotel's long history.  What I can say about this hotel is it's located centrally, near to the L but the elegance ends after you walk through the beautiful lobby. No coffee maker or tea in the room, no. bottled water in the room, wall mounted shampoo pump makes you feel like you're in a Hilton Garden Inn not an historic Hilton property. Breakfast buffet was not good and no worth the money, though the service was good. A whole salad setup but only one communal bowl of dressing, no oil/vinegar, no fat free options. The cinnamon rolls were made out of concrete, looks like something that came"
1213,"The whole experience was beautiful and felt like the hotel had been plucked out of the 1920s and placed into the modern day. However, when I went to go connect to the guest's wifi and realized it would cost me 15 bucks a night, the magic faded very quickly. "
1214,"After staying here multiple, multiple times, The Palmer House remains a first class property based on the Chicago location, beauty of the hotel, the staff and overall comfort that Hilton provides.  We've taken other friends with us and they concur that The Palmer House is first class in every way."
1215,The Palmer House is a gem. Have been staying there for 20 years. It’s a short walk to the train station and close to everything so you don’t need a car. Very relaxing way to see a great American city.
1216,"I am a Hilton member and usually love the service you get at Hilton properties.  Unfortunately, this property did not meet that standard.  My main complaint revolves around the refrigerator. I have some items I would like to keep refrigerated.  There is a fridge in the room, but it is ONLY for the items they stocked.  Additionally, there are sensors under the items, so you cannot move them or you will be charged.  As a parent, I cannot imagine what it would be like having a kid here because of that.    Anyway, it has a note on the fridge that if you need to store items, call the front desk for assistance.  I contacted their help line, and I was told that they can bring up another fridge, but FOR A FEE of $40.  It seems kind of money-grabbing to me that you would have a fridge"
1217,"Just checked in an hour ago - and am dreading spending 3 nights here.  The room is OLD, very weirdly designed.  Two double beds, huge room, 2 sets of closets and 2 full bathrooms.  Sounds good - but to me it's just weird.  Dated carpeting, very dated bed linens.  Big traveler pet peeve - the desk is facing one wall - the TV is on the complete opposite wall so your back is to it.  Do they not test with business travelers who have to work in the evenings? Final huge compliant - the desk and related chair are so off from any ergonomic fit it's crazy.  I am a tall person, and am literally reaching UP to the keyboard to work on my lap top because the chair is so low.  I will not return and do not recommend it."
1218,"The lobby of this hotel is incredible but I would visit it and not stay here! The rooms are very small, the corridors noisy and no free WiFi! This is a relatively expensive hotel with absolutely no benefit if you intend to be out all day. "
1219,"Visited on a business trip and liked the convenient location in downtown Chicago that allowed for walking to my work location and Chicago attractions.  Also like to maintain my fitness routine when I travel, and loved the full scale gym on the property.   Also enjoyed getting discount on breakfast in the dinning room with HH Gold and Diamond access.  Also has a Starbucks located onsite.  Not sure if I would stay for personal travel, but would recommend for Business if you want a convenient/all access morning routine."
1220,"Well folks this property used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago.  It's sadly taken a severe hit in the last couple of months.  I'm a Hilton Diamond member and if my experience is poor, anyone with less status will likely be in the hurt locker!    I went from an amazing welcome upon arriving to ""ah you"" ...  Also generally a beautiful room to one that needs to be refurbished.  I fear that this is the path this property is going down and it breaks my heart.    They've also closed the executive lounge which was a great retreat for breakfast or afternoon tea.  The people in the lounge were first class.  Finally Diamond members or any members with status no longer get executive floor privilege without begging.   If I choose to stay again, I will update this review."
1221,Great location lovely lobby and bar ... rooms slightly dated but clean and comfortable. Initially put in a room next to lifts really noisy the whole of the night ! Asked to be moved and was helpful .... did actually say they are aware of the noisy rooms but still put people in them !!!
1222,"Palmer House offers consistent excellence.   This stately hotel is truly one of America's classic big city hotels offering great location, beautiful lobby and overall elegance.  Highly recommend for a couples getaway. "
1223,"Accommodations, staff and amenities were all fabulous!  Room was comfortable! Food was good, desserts were fantastic!  Beautiful lobby—cozy and with lots of character!  An iconic place for a great benefit gala!  We will return for sure!"
1224,"I stayed here for business, and probably would never come back. The only redeeming quality was that it's a Hilton property and I wanted points. I wasn't satisfied by the level of service (as such a big hotel, they are unable to provide adequate service). I wasn't given bottles of water upon check in, the doormen didn't open the doors or try to call me a cab when I had my luggage etc. I had to schlep everything to my room on my own. The rooms were also old, furniture also too old, and facilities not in good condition. Would not recommend."
1225,"I've stayed at the Palmer House over the years, and some things have been upgraded nicely.  The fitness center is a nice addition.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  The location is also great."
1226,"Lobby is classic ornate masterpiece dating back a hundred years. The hotel rooms also appear to date back 100 years...maybe 50 years. Bathroom was nasty with caulk in shower and around toilet that looked like a 10 year old did the job. I dated the bathroom based on the shower knob, which is the same moen valve that was in my home growing up—1960’s edition. I paid for a king size bed, but room had a queen size bed. I noticed this after we got back to room after an event so it was too late to change.  There are so many beautiful hotels in the loop, I suggest staying at anyone of them. But come here for cocktail if you want to sit in a beautiful lobby."
1227,"A storied property and beautiful hotel.  Excellent staff, services, breakfasts and bar.  Wonderful room even if ""standard."" Close to museums, orchestra Hall. I took train to Chicago, easy transfer.  Concierge was very helpful."
1228,Stayed at Palmer House hotel in Chicago for CrimeCon crowd solve. Beautiful historic hotel. Conference rooms were good. Nice room. The restaurant in the hotel had great service and food. Excellent location for restaurants and shopping.
1229,"Very positive experience as a Hilton Diamond Honors member. The usual free water, and the staff member handling my checkin was assiduous in pointing out all of the amenities available to me at their property as a Diamond. Got a free room upgrade. Room was clean, linens were excellent, no particular signs of wear on furnishings or bathroom furniture. Wifi was fast. Some of these reviewers seem to have encountered worn elements in their rooms but I saw no sign of that myself. Great stay at a good price for a random trip to Chicago downtown with plenty of good places to eat in the immediate area."
1230,Wonderful hotel! Best location! everything is in walking distance and uber wasn't expensive! Tons of restaurants in the area many walking distance! Also very close to the loop and Michigan Ave! The hotel itself was beautiful! The staff was friendly! Many eating spots in the hotel and a starbucks which was very helpful!
1231,This hotel has a stunning lobby and wonderful history - a must see if you are downtown Chicago!  Be sure to get a brownie or two(developed by Palmer House) and check out the Empire Room before you check out.    
1232,"The bedding was superb and what I would expect from Hilton properties. The room was either too cold or too hot. I could not find a happy medium with the thermostat. Chips on beverage/snack cart in room were expired (did not realize until I had eaten several), but I was not charged for this. "
1233,"We stay at the Palmer House often when we travel to Chicago. Love the architecture & decor. This time something seemed off, nothing specific just less attention to detail & customer service. We decided to try a different hotel for our next visit."
1234,"I stayed here for a weekend during a conference I was at and overall my experience was a good one. The hotel is absolutely beautiful in the common areas and the location is great. Layout can be a bit confusing (hallways, separate elevators to different floors), but they have signs.  The rooms are all differently sized, but one thing was a constant - small bathrooms with poor fit and finish. I say this due to some peeling/bubbled wallpaper, shower with a poor drain and toilet that randomly would not flush. My room was clean for the most part, but I’ve seen better kept rooms in my experiences elsewhere.   Overall service was decent. The people in charge of bags were not very professional. Random side conversations in front of guests, unfriendly attitude and one got upset with me"
1235,"The Palmer House is historic and beautiful.  The rooms however are extremely small.  If you can't fit a queen sized bed in the room...it's small. No room for a fridge, but they can squeeze a minibar in.   would not stay at or recommend this hotel."
1236,"I had the best time at this hotel. The location was beyond perfect. I was given great food recommendations as well as fun events by Amira. She was extremely sweet and knowledgeable. Every question that I had she was able to give me her expertise. This is the most enjoyable time that I’ve had in a while! She also gave me a grand experience card. I have no doubt that I’ll be back again. Unfortunately, I was unable to purchase a package for vacation but after my experience with Amira and this hotel I certainly will buy one in the future.   I gave this only 4 stars because I stayed with a friend of mine and we saw mildew in the bathroom. Wasn’t properly cleaned. "
1237,"I have stayed at the Palmer House in the past and absolutely loved it. However, after my last trip I can honestly say I will not stay here again. I am a Hilton Honors Gold Member. This is the worst Hilton I stayed at. I’ve stayed at a lot of different hotels in Europe and US. Some were very old. But old doesn’t mean disgusting, like the Palmer House now is.  The lobby is still breathtaking. But once you go to the rooms, the hallways are not clean. There are candy wrappers and trash left everywhere. Not sure if the staff looks for this at all. Our original room had rips in the shade, missing hardware in the dresser, stain on the comforter, stained “clean” folded towels, veneers missing on furniture, stained ottoman, wallpaper peeling off, dirt and mold on bathroom tile and grout"
1238,This place is so horrible I can't believe they're charging people to stay here don't take my word for it look at the pictures. They have the nerve to have a mini bar. There's no exhaust in the bathroom I'm sure there is mold!
1239,"I stayed at Palmer House for President's weekend in Chicago. My first issue with the place was that they could not guarantee an early check in after a red eye. When I called in advance, I was given a curt response and then they hung up.  When I arrived, there was a room. This hotel is absolutely HUGE. Unless they are 100% sold out, which probably is never the case, they should be able to give you a room. My room was in the farthest corner of the hotel, the view was a brick wall that had no natural sunlight so the room had a dark, dank, feeling.  The hallways are large and wind around in a maze. The room was really basic, and seemed like an inefficient use of space.  The closet was a full walk in closet, and the bathroom was so tight, only one person could stand in it at a time. "
1240,Having previously stayed in the more modern Hyatt near the river we wanted to stay in somewhere with some character and it has bags of it. The main bar or lobby area is one of the most stunning rooms anywhere and we really enjoyed having a drink here before we went out for dinner on an evening. The location was great to get around and there were plenty of cafes nearby to sit and watch the world go by from. Inside the hotel they have various businesses including a Starbucks which was great to wake up and head down there for my morning coffee. Although the rooms weren’t my particular taste they were still very nice and getting there was easy there were more lifts than you know what to do with. Check in and out was easy too and they were very helpful especially giving us some idea
1241,This is my 3rd visit to this historic hotel and every time I learn more about the family namesake hotel.   This time I was visited for 4 nights.   As usual it was a great stay.   He lobby bar just is amazing looking and even more with who you can meet there. The food is also very good.
1242,"The Palmer House is always a great hotel, but also a tremendous bargain at $120 a night. We decided it was cheaper to fly, and not have to pay the $80 a night valet parking fee. Be sure to check the valet fees in advance!"
1243,"The customer service and attitudes of the entire staff at the Palmer House were amazing. I never felt rushed or that I was a burden to anyone. The gentleman that checked us in was very nice. He took the time to explain our upgrade and extra benefits. However, my biggest praise goes to Security. In an attempt to not lose my car key fob, I placed them in a drawer that I sadly forgot to check before we checked out. I realized halfway through the security checkpoint what I had done. I called the front desk who were very kind and not annoyed, who then put me through to Security. Despite the long hold they were able to locate my keys and said they could send them to me. I assumed that they were just saying that to make me feel better, but when I received my tracking number via email"
1244,"I am not one to complain. I’ve seen a lot in my life so I normally let things go easily however I must state my dissatisfaction for making my mom’s 62 b-day celebration a disappointment to me. My mom had a blast is the only reason I’m not downstairs in the lobby making a bigger fuss. So we checked in and all was great. I brought my mom in from Flint, MI for an escape. After realizing the rates dropped $60 per night from when I booked in Sept. I received no help in adjusting the rate - even as a Hilton Honors member. Aqsa Khan and Denise made bring management worthless. So I called the Hilton honors desk and as I knew they couldn’t assist because the reservation had already started and it was at the discretion of management on site to which I was consistently told they didn’t"
1245,The Palmer House is my second home. The best food and service at Lockwood. Top management team as well. I visit at least twice a week. From the door and bell staff until I stuff myself with chef Jason's creations and drown myself at the bar this is the place to be. Marty the bar mixologist is number one. Try room 23-120. Wet bar and a great view. Top security team and Ken Price can give you the history of the hotel. I am Kevin Majors and you can e mail me and I will reply. Kevinmajors@yahoo.com
1246,"The hotel is historic and iconic but could use some updating without compromising the nostalgia of it all.  Our room was large but lacked a refigerator.  If you want a coffee pot in your room, you will need to request one.  We stayed at the hotel for an event we were attending.  It was convenient to be on sight but the walls were very thin and our neighbors spoke loudly, not yelling or anything but we could hear everything they said very clearly and had to turn the tv on in an attempt to drown them out.  The beds were full size not queen and not as comfortable as you expect from a Hilton Hotel.  The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  The cost did not reflect the Hilton Quality.  For the price you should get a complimentary brownie, after all this is were it"
1247,"Chose 2 rooms for 2 nights @ Palmer House Hilton in the Chicago Loop. I’d have been happier at the Hampton Inn down the street. Here’s the bad, which far outweighs the good, a few redeeming virtues, and some photographic evidence.  THE BAD  LOUNGE ACCESS: What lounge? I chose this full-service Hilton to have executive lounge access. I was told at check-in that despite zero affirmation on the web site, the executive lounge is permanently closed due to overcrowding. There goes my free breakfast, cocktails, and a place to work quietly. Nothing on the web site or mobile site suggested that the lounge was closed.  THE ROOM: I had to ask for an upgrade to the executive-level floor; shouldn't a Diamond member be offered this? And what a disappointment: rooms are big, but less than"
1248,"This hotel has a wonderful history and a great location. You can tell that at some point in time, this was valued by the management. Now, it’s poorly run, overcrowded, and outmatched by nearly every other hotel in the area. Exposed hanging electrical outlets from the ceiling went unrepaired for more than 12 hours before someone came to look at the hazard. I literally had to walk around and under exposed electrical wires. What in hilton honors are they thinking.  Diamond status? = nothing. No exec lounge, no water, no coffee maker, have breakfast with everyone in the lobby, but be prepared to wait 30 minutes to be seated.  Valet apparently matched my room with someone else’s car, so I have been charged for their parking. We’ll see if I get refunded for that.  I have not as of"
1249,"It was fantastic seeing all the architecture and photographs of well-known stars and celebrities of yesteryear.  The dining experience in the restaurants on premises was phenomenal, and the staff was very kind."
1250,These dudes went above and beyond for sure. My wife and I stayed here after a bad car accident and these two were incredibly compassionate and courteous. Give these guys a raise for sure! Will return just bc of how pleasant they made our first unexpected stay.
1251,"This historic, iconic Chicago hotel remains stunningly beautiful, with its unique charm kept intact.  Love all the photos of the stars who played the Empire Room adorning the hallways. Hotel staff makes you feel special.  The location is great and it's very affordable."
1252,"This hotel was downtown Chicago placed in a nice area surrounded by shopping centers and what seemed to be a metro station for transportation. The hotel has a few restaurants inside and a Starbucks for your morning coffee. The rooms were very clean, comfortable and spacious. Overall enjoyable stay. "
1253,"This hotel looks like a hotel that would treat guests properly, be clean, and reasonable. It is not.   The reception desk is one level up from street level.  We were yelled by a hotel employee for starting up the escalator with our luggage.  Apparently, we had to use an elevator instead.   We tried to check in at 11:30 AM and the desk agent promptly informed us that there was a $25 early check-in charge before noon. (We are Hilton Honors members) We asked to check our bags---they send us back downstairs to do so.  There is no bell serverice where you need it--and the front desk could not care less.  The lobby looks nice, but the rest of the hotel is garbage.  The room had water damage that was pootly covered by paint.   We shipped a package to ourselves at the hotel.  The front"
1254,"Beautiful hotel in the Loop area of Chicago and close to many attractions. The room was spacious and very clean. The hotel is huge and requires a staff complement to support that number of guests. We found that attention to details was lacking and responses to our requests were delayed. The elevators were not operating properly and guests became frustrated with the amount of time spent waiting that we would jump on any elevator up or down to just get in. Finally, there was no final bill under the door. Instead, we had to go to the check-out desk and had no time to review the billing errors since we wasted so much time waiting for the elevator and then had to proceed to the airport.  "
1255,Staff was amazing.  Beds are very small (double)  bathroom definitely needed some updating.   The burger place was closed every time we tried to go. Location great.  Starbucks on-site.  Lots of stores close by.   
1256,The Palmer House - Chicago  There are three different parts of this experience of the Palmer House hotel in Chicago to share.  I initially booked this stay online for a weekend with my kids.  I chose a higher-end hotel because I was traveling with my kids and they like things like the pool and the spacious rooms.  I picked their standard room because it was during a weekend of nice weather which meant we would not be in the room a whole bunch.  Room 1  We checked into the Palmer House after an excessively long line and wait in the hotel lobby.  It took us about an hour to wait in the long snakey line set up just to check-in.  After we got to our room we had noticed right away black mold on the wall above the doorway and black mold in the bathroom.  I have a kid with asthma and
1257,I`ve stayed at The Palmer House many times.I did appreciate the upgrade to a King room. Usually I have a good experience at this hotel. I did not like that I had paid for a Stay and Park package only to see that I was charged $85 for parking. Had I not caught this I would have been stuck. I asked before arriving if I should just pull up to Valet in front of hotel. They said yes. Upon arriving I confirmed with valet it was stay and park. They acknowledged it was. So strange that I was really supposed to self park across the street for this package after all. Also I dont like people asking for tips ahead of time. Bag drop did that. I also did not like Hilton Grand Vacations chasing me to the elevator to throw sales pitch. 
1258,Went for a stay vacation at the Palmer House for 1 week Hotel is running on its 100 year old history Lack of security - anyone can walk into the hotel and go up to the rooms Overpriced even by Chicago standards Dogs are allowed and may keep you awake at night with their barking They did me
1259,"We are on 3rd day of stay at Palmer House. 2/3 days we have not had housekeeping services. None. I even called front desk - they said they would ""notify housekeeping"" - and nothing.  Asked if they could at least empty trash and bring towels. Nope. I certainly expect more from a Hilton."
1260,"We met our daughters and their families for a long weekend in Chicago.  We chose this Hilton property for its location, and the restaurant Potters located within.  We have stayed before and loved the Pub for a meal with kids.  We saw the pool was closed and were disappointed with that, but then got checked in and found Potters was closed for the weekend.  WTH.  So disappointed.  Instead went with 8 of us to Lockwood, the fancier restaurant the first night.  Crazy expensive.  Ok food.  Slow service.  Waiter forgot to take drink orders.  We only saw him once or twice our entire meal.  He did make sure to tack on 20% gratuity.  The rooms are soooooooo small.  Not sure what kind we had last time, but they were not this cramped and claustrophobic.  Also disappointing.  Still"
1261,"If you love grand, historical buildings and want a superb location for arts and culture in the Loop, I don't know how you could do better. To be sure, the rooms are a little on the old side but they have cool mirrors and other touches.  Walking through the glorious lobby a couple times a day can take you back to the glamour days of the 30's and 40's. Symphony is a block away, Millennium Park and the Art Institute are 2 blocks.  I felt completely comfortable as an older, single woman.  Wish the drinks in the lobby weren't so pricey. "
1262,"Palmer May have been a good hotel in the past but not is overpriced fo what the offer.  Definitely need some cleaning, remodeling and renovation!  Elevator very slow and for the most part didn’t stop at our floor.  The first room they gave us smelled so like bleach we had to change rooms.  Second room had old carpet broken mirror , clogged tub.... i can go on. There are pics of our room attached to this review. No room service in the evening ( guess they had it just few hrs a day)  Definitely will not stay at this hotel again. "
1263,"The lobby was stunning! Found the hotel room small and could feel that it is pretty old. Though renovated well, the size just doesn’t do justice.   The staff was courteous. I liked the veg burger I ordered from in-room dining. "
1264,"The hotel's lobby, ballroom, and restaurants are beautiful and worth coming in and of themselves. But just for a drink or some food. Like a lot of great old hotels in big American cities, the rooms just aren't designed for modern sensibilities or standards. They're quite small, especially the bathrooms where it feels quite like taking a shower in a closet. The windows aren't double-paned, as far as I can tell, meaning on cold winter nights you really have to crank the heat to stay comfortable. If your room is designed to be able to adjoin another room, you'll be able to see light from the other room in the dark and hear everything your neighbors are saying. The upside, if any, is at least the rooms aren't all that expensive. Expected more, though."
1265,"Palmer House is historic and iconic. Stunning lobby.   Visit for the lobby.  Hang out in the lobby.  Tiny rooms in this classic hotel.   Tiny beds in tiny rooms.   Decent WiFi, ok linens.   Good location and easy walking distance for art institute and cbic heatre"
1266,"I have stayed here many times, and this was another excellent stay. The lobby/bar area is beautiful. The location is right in the middle of downtown with plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
1267,"Upon arrival to the hotel we were checked in promptly and offered complimentary bottles of water but when we got to our room there was old room service on a tray in the hallway we dropped our bags and made a member of reception staff aware of the tray. The next day entering the hallway the tray was still there and when we spoke to a member of staff and explained it had now started to smell she suggested ""move it to the other end of the corridor yourself.""  Also during our stay our toilet broke and after reporting the problem, again, there was a delay in it being resolved which resulted in me having to have my hand in the top of the toilet. We were also told while the issue was happening with the toilet that we would have to use the ones at the gym 10 floors down.  As many other"
1268,"We stayed at Palmer House for 2 nights in January 2020.   From the moment the doorman greeted us to help with luggage to the housekeeping gentleman who smiled and asked us how our day was going, this staff are among the kindest, smiling staff we have ever encountered.  It really made such a difference at a time when out stay there was nerve racking!    We stayed in a King accessible room, which was different from our original reservation as a King Executive Suite (Our only hiccup, which I just wasn't in the head space to argue about).  It was a very spacious room, especially the bathroom and it suited our needs, since we were really only there to sleep!   I have able to make some last minute changes on my presentation and display, without it really being inconvenient.   The"
1269,"Downside: Make sure you bring your own coffee and tea facility as there is none in the room Upside: Friendly staff, value for money, good location, food in restaurants are good quality and delicious!!"
1270,I expect to see Gable and Lombard descending the steps into the bar at any moment.  Beautiful hotel and customer service is exceptional.  It’s not a new hotel but beautifully maintained historic hotel. Room service is speedy and food is hot.
1271,"We live in the Chicago area and I work just down the street. We chose to stay here because of a half marathon starting from Soldier Field not far from the hotel. We asked in advance about a late check-out to be able to shower after the race, and were told it would be $25, which is fine. This morning the front desk clarified $25 per additional hour. The other surprise was no coffee maker in the room- what hotel  in this day and age doesn't have coffee in the room???!!! Room service brought a maker up, though it doesn't work well. This was our first time staying here and will be the last. We will not be coming back, will not refer any guests and I will not refer out of town colleagues. The breakfast staff is incredible- they deserve 5 stars. Hotel management, you have a lot of"
1272,"As a HHonors Gold member, I really expect better from a Hilton property. Wallpaper in the room was falling off in multiple places in the room. Would prefer a shower only rather than shower/tub combo, but that's personal preference. Hair blower was one of the cheapest I have ever used. VERY THIN WALLS. Lobby was gorgeous. Service twice at breakfast and once at Potters was absolutely horrendous. One server at Potters didn't know the menu and was not helpful. Had to wait about 7 minutes to get greeted and over 12 minutes after that for him to return to take an order. Asked about hot sauce and had to walk around the restaurant to find the right one at a different table. Another meal we had at Potters was great and Manny was AMAZING, although the food was kind of a let down. Overall"
1273,"I had high hopes for this hotel. My stay was a disaster.   The executive level room itself was not worth the extra cost, the room was dated - wallpaper coming off the walls, a chipped bathroom mirror, a 2 to 3 inch gap under a poorly fitting bathroom door, pulled up and torn carpet edges. The layout of the room was very strange and there was a hallway that led to nowhere at the side of the room.   We were awoken during to loud construction in the hotel next to and above our room. Housekeeping also had a cell phone ringer which went off loudly a number of times. Prior to my arrival, I had asked if a refrigerator came with my room or not and I was told it was usually $40 but they would comp it for me. When I arrived, I was told that my room would always have come with a fridge at"
1274,The hotel is on a perfect location it's its walking distance to everywhere on downtown chicago.the staff are very professional with great attitude.the hotel is beautiful the room clean and comfortable
1275,"We went on our first vacation of the year and Palmer House was the best choice. We stayed from January 18th until January 21st, Edward and Keely in guest services were very helpful. Concierge Nicholas and Robert gave us all the point of interest. The hotel is located in the loop. State St shopping, millennium park, Wills Tower all are writhing 5-10 mins of walking distance. There’s a ton of restaurants. The hotel itself has many dining and take out options. We stayed at the executive level the best part Being the executive floor has their own elevators and needs your room key to access."
1276,"Great location and hotel. Stayed for 3 nights and couldn’t ask for a better location. Within walking distance to everything, a block or 2 to Macy’s, target, cvs, museums, the river, restaurants!!! Rooms are small but really clean and well equipped. Starbucks on site. The bar has the most amazing ceiling, literally a work of art!! Give the flat top grill  a go, less than 2 minutes walk delicious food and great value. "
1277,"The Palmer House is a wonderful example of excellence.  The service in the Potter's Chicago Burger Bar the night we stayed was very shaky, but the the rest of the staff was excellent.  I highly recommend Palmer House! "
1278,"Went for 50 something girls weekend which included theater tickets. Loved everything about the hotel, including its location in the theater district.  Every staff member was pleasant and anticipated our needs. Front desk got us pleasantly upgraded. Our rooms were huge and adjoining. Hotel bar was beautiful and fun. Breakfast left us feeling completely satisfied.  This iconic beauty has to be experienced. Go here, you’ll be delighted."
1279," Poked on the Executive level (paid extra) only to find out the Executive level service was barely nonexistent. Three crappy luke warm appetizers and cold breakfast buffet. Staff was helpful and did refund some points to my account. But, from what was a prior experience to this recent experience turned me off. Room was clean, but paint was peeling off the bathroom door. In-room phone broken and TV reception was poor. It wasn’t until next morning the TV menu worked. Too many other options in Chicago. Don’t plan on making this hotel an option next visit "
1280,"We have never stayed in a city hotel that is as beautiful and in such a good location as this hotel. The service is at a very high level, and with c and mass the requirements are met quickly and with quality.  Breakfast is good but only monotonous.  The lobby is lovely and has a beautiful cafe."
1281,We arrived in town on a Sat night. With a reservation that had been made for months. The entire hotel was shut  down. We felt like they had had plenty of time to notify us. It was easy enough to change but thank goodness I was a savvy traveler.
1282,"Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, friendly place. The staff was wonderful. We arrived early to Chicago & they were able to accommodate us in a room. We had an amazing city view. You can walk 10-15 min to Navy pier, millennium park and Magnificent mile or uber for a few bucks. The city cancelled St Pats parade & festivities due to Covid-19 but the hotel hosted a small party downstairs that kept us entertained & our son with games without leaving the hotel. I would stay here again."
1283,"Even in the concierge rooms, needed repairs are openly visible: dresser doors that won't stay shut, mars and scratches on furniture, etc.  Even the shower curtain and its rod are dated; it has been quite awhile since I had taken a shower in a crowded tub without a curtain rod that bowed out for additional space.  Still, the location and amenities of the Sheraton are hard to beat and the staff are pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable."
1284,The room was nice. The view was amazing. Parking was high but that’s Chicago.  Checking in was such a breeze and everyone was so nice and helpful. I wish kore restaurants were in walking distance of the hotel but just doordashed my food for the night.
1285,"You’ve probably seen the hidden camera investigative reports that revealed that housekeeping often just rinses and wipes down glassware in hotel rooms. I had kind of forgotten and put that out of my mind. However, it came flooding back when I found a coffee mug in my room with a few drops of coffee stains inside and smeared lip prints on the edge. I left it sitting out hoping it would be replaced with a clean one. I came back after my room being cleaned and found the exact same mug on the shelf with the same spots and same smeared lip prints. ICK! In these days of coronavirus, this is unacceptable!  Always wash your hotel glassware yourself people! Hotel was otherwise ok."
1286,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Very professional and Guest friendly. Was here for all star weekend and despite the crowds and numerous activities going on The Sheraton Grand was on point. everything you need is in the hotel and within walking distance, there is a whole foods, a movie theater and numerous restaurants  a block or less away. i really enjoyed my stay here and with the Magnificent mile and other attractions within walking distance this is the idea location. Jeffery from the front desk was amazing as well at check in Shout Out to Jeffrey."
1287,Beautiful hotel! Came here for the Cubs Convention. It is really nice in here! The ballroom conference rooms are super big. In a great location with so much around in the heart of Chicago. I had a great time! 
1288,"We had a great stay at the Sheraton Grand for St Patrick's Day 2019 -- the hotel is not only located right on the river, but overlooking right where they turn the river green. We had a front row view!  The hotel has a huge lobby - great for meeting up with your group. They had a quick hotel bar and also were located near to a few other restaurants/bars.  Quick walk over the river to the Loop and located at the start of Magnificent Miles - tons of shopping.    The rooms were clean and quiet.  We definitely would stay at this property again."
1289,"I stayed here for a business conference but doubt I would ever stay here on my own dime. Beds were very comfortable and had a great location with great views of the city. However, internet is extra $15 per day, microwave/fridge must be requested (although website says they are included), I had trouble getting ahold of anyone to order room service, no one ever cleaned my hotel room and there were dishes from a number of rooms on my floor that just sat in hall way ALL day. They only got removed when I called and asked later in day. Front desk staff were very nice but concierge refused to answer my question until after he spent a couple minutes condescending me."
1290,"My family and I were here for a martial arts tournament. This hotel is a great venue, especially for such a large tournament. The competition area that was set up for the tournament had ample space. The main lobby of the hotel was a great place to relax while waiting for my son to compete. Guest rooms are nice, clean, and quiet. Staff is friendly. Great location right on the river."
1291,"Being big Chicago sports fans we visit the city every Christmas to get our fix - thankfully I'm not reviewing the sports teams because they went 1-3 on our visit this time! I am reviewing the hotel though and that's a good thing! We had another excellent stay. Every member of staff we dealt with was very polite and helpful (special mention to the ladies in Starbucks), and several remembered us from our previous visits without even being prompted. One of the managers (David Heffernan) went out of his way to say hello and ask us if there was anything we needed when he spotted us in the lobby and another came out to wish us a safe trip home after we checked out! We must give a special shout out to Michael and John (Tiritilli) on the door too. Once again they took great care of us"
1292,"Good - beautiful, clean & nice views. Older set up ( no usb plugs ) small washrooms. Our room had a weird angle had to really tilt the tv. Close to a lot of things the bean, good restaurants etc. Nice indoor pool but what a job to find it. Bad - no fridge. Just there “touch it” ( motion sensors ) and pay fridge and snack center. Small Pringle’s $8!!! Not cool in 2020 to have this - esp with kids.  Rushed - 7 hr drive wanted to use valet ( told to self park ) need help with luggage ( get a sigh and “ok” ) checked in with app - told not working had to line up. No instructions where was what.  Broken - our kids DVD player. When it made its way to our room. 1 hr to talk with the luggage people, manager on duty ( Andrew was very helpful ) and then security. To be fair they did refund"
1293,"I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels and have of course had the periodic issue here and there, but my stay at the Sheraton Grand in Chicago had so many issues, it was hard to keep track. An absolute nightmare! Even after completing the post-stay survey the hotel sent and listing the multitude of issues and problems during my stay, I received a stock response from a front desk supervisor. I value feedback from others on Trip Advisor and hopefully my feedback is helpful."
1294,"It was my first visit to the cold and Windy City of Chicago for a business trip. The hotel probably deserves 4 stars, but it was the overall experience, prompt customer service and the nice gym and pool that earned them the extra star.   Checkin was a breeze. The staff extremely helpful with an early check in and very courteous compared to US standards (not to compare to Asia obviously). The hotel is well maintained, rooms were clean and equipped with nice Starbucks coffee, complimentary bottle of water and nice comfortable bed. However, the room was slightly small and bathroom toiletries could have been a bit better. As I mentioned earlier, the gym and pool area were nice and it is always great to get some exercise in when on business travel. The location is awesome and in"
1295,"The highs: - beautiful facility on the river - food at Shula's is excellent - friendly helpful staff The lows: - the hot water is non-existent - get ready for a lukewarm (at best) shower - old bones - they supposedly refurbished the rooms, but instead they simply painted, put in new carpet and possibly a new bed.  The bathrooms are old and the furniture is old (but that's ok). - concierge lounge - nice room, absolutely terrible selection of food.  The eggs for some reason taste like they have saw dust in them, no bacon or sausage - cold cuts, fruit - melon, no berries or the like, I guess they have a pretty good bread selection (which I don't eat).  But clearly the worst run concierge I have experienced in a long time. - fitness facility - small and cramped for a hotel this"
1296,"The hotel is in an ideal spot. Right by the water and so close to parks, restaurants and so much to do. It was a tiny room where everything in it cost extra though. Overall I would stay again as the ideal location helps make up for the room."
1297,"Really enjoyed staying at the Sheraton on business. It was an easy walk to the Mag mile and other things. I had a beautiful view from the river! The lobby was pretty dead with the main bar closed, but overall a good stay. I'll see myself back here next year I think!"
1298,"We celebrated New Year Eve with fire works by hotel. Large loft , dinnig lounge and breakfast jn basement area. Nice decor and excellent view of skyline. Rooms are large and spacious.  Breakfast is not included in charges for Room.  You have to order from Menu. Children look forward for lots of varities in foods and got disppointed. We get one Drinking Water Bottle as coutsey service.  No courtsy hot coffee and water cooler in lounge."
1299,Rooms are a bit dated. Aircon very noisy. Place is a bit soulless. Main bar was shut. Very large halls and areas that lack character. The fitness suite is average. The location is good. That’s about it.
1300,"I was very surprised by the great service at this huge convention type hotel. Everyone was friendly even though it was super busy for New Year’s. The housekeeping staff were also very happy and seemed to enjoy their work.  I did mobile check in but later went downstairs to speak with the Bonvoy desk attendant about late checkout and bonus points. He welcomed me as titanium elite and confirmed our 4PM checkout and recommended RPM Steak as I asked for dinner recommendations. Even though this is a huge hotel, service was efficient and the concierge was particularly helpful with walking directions to Michigan Ave.  We stayed here for one night (Dec 31) in a river front facing room (2911). I requested an upgrade online and the higher floor views were amazing. The midnight fireworks"
1301,Stayed here for a national conference. Nice rooms with great location to Michigan Ave etc. located along the River with easy access. Clean rooms. Staff was very attentive. Walking distance to most anything you would want to do.
1302,"The Hotel is quite good. Location great, but watch your bill at all times. They seem to charge you for drinks you don’t have because there system of knowing who is buying the drinks is very poor. Also they will put money on hold on your credit card every day for a room charge even if you have paid the room in advance. So you may over spend on your card thinking you have money there and them be charged by your bank while waiting for the money to be refunded by the Hotel. Which they shouldn’t of touched in the first place."
1303,"I like the hotel. But the aircon blows onto the bed which is annoying and they put money on your credit card on hold so you can not spend that money, even if you have paid for the room upfront. This makes no sense when you have paid for the room and they are still taking money for the room. They need to have a better way of knowing who has paid and who hasn’t. Being such a big company very bad management. Also they charge you for drink that you didn’t have, so suggest checking your bill not putting key into checkout box near reception."
1304,"This was a very pleasant surprise,  was ease to get to and was in a perfect location to the Navy pier and all the restaurants and shopping!  Family loved it !  Clean and great services!  Right in the river, good views.  Staff was very helpful!!!!"
1305,Loved the views and location of the hotel. The hotel was well staffed for NYE and kept their composure despite the antics of some guests. Response to the marriott app chat was quick and efficient. Parking was very expensive and we were not fans of the mini bar with pressure sensors automatically charging guests. Will still stay again. 
1306,"We stayed here one night with family. Rooms are clean and updated, though I was surprised there weren't more USB ports for charging. Great city and river views from our room. Uber pick up is easy. We had a problem at check in- I asked about club lounge access and was told our Bonvoy status wasn't eligible at this hotel. After we reviewed our reservation that clearly listed lounge access, we returned downstairs and were told a mistake was made and we got the situation corrected. Breakfast area in club lounge was way too small, as it is in most hotels, so get there early. All employees were friendly and helpful. "
1307,"We arrived at 1.45pm and didn’t get into our room until 4.25pm.  We booked a family room, however the additional bed wasn’t made up and when we called for it to be made up, we are still waiting....we have been waiting for over an hour, with young children at close to 11pm at night. "
1308,"As soon as we got there, the guys helped us get unloaded.  Then we waited a little bit to get checked in.  As soon as I heard the lady speaking, I KNEW she was sick.  She had a sore throat, and couldn't talk that well.  I really didn't want her to check us in, because I didn't want to risk the chance of either my husband or I getting sick. Which my husband is terminally ill with lung cancer,  and if he gets sick, and developes a fever, he can die.  Well, we BOTH got sick.  Thankfully he didn't get as sick as I did.  When I called the hotel management to tell them what had happened, she knew who checked us in, and said, yes she had a sore throught, and couldn't talk, but she wasn't sick.  Would you like to talk to her?  What's the point?  She would've argued she wasn't sick.  But"
1309,"I stay here annually now for a weekend trip to Chicago with my girlfriend and another young couple, while I don’t explore the intricacies of some hotel frequenters (there are longer lists of services available at nicer hotels like this one), I can speak for the comfort and high quality of the stay. Great price for the location in my humble opinion! Short walk to the Loop, near the water, and right on the river too. Whole Foods is next door to fuel up for a long day, and Uber/Lyft pickup outside the Sheraton is smooth and organized. "
1310,"We really enjoyed our time at the Sheraton. We upgraded to a river view room facing the city. The staff was very helpful. Magnificent Mile was easy to walk to. Parking garage below the hotel was so easy to get to, in, and out of. The only issue we had was the phone would ring once or twice until midnight. I unplugged it at that time."
1311,"Hotel was clean and pleasant and the staff were friendly. Rooms were generous size, and beds were very comfortable. Disappointed that wifi wasn't free here, though this was the only thing we were disappointed with."
1312,"I have stayed at this property several times over the years and it use to be my hotel of choice--ever since the Marriott merger, this property has been going completely down hill.  When attempting to change my reservation I was told by several different employees 3 different variations of their ""new cancellation policies.""  No one seemed to be able to give me a straight answer to my questions and the managers refused to provide me with a refund after attempting to cancel my reservation within 72 hours of my stay.  The employees clearly need training on the new policies and should be able to speak to them with conviction.  SPG members should be clearly notified of the changes in policy after the merger to Marriott, and the important nuances between ""Bonvoy"" and SPG rewards.  I"
1313,This very large hotel has very comfortable rooms and lovely common spaces with a pool and exercise gym and a great restaurant as well as several coffee and lunch venues in the hotel. Well situated. Have stayed here many time.
1314,"This is a grand old dame, but dated. The nickel and dime you for everthing. The catered food is not up to what you would expect and the staff is surley. They act like they don't want to be here. I was there for a conference and really wish I booked some where else."
1315,"I enjoyed my stay the Sheraton Grand Chicago. I was told that would get a guest room on a high floor (29th) that had been renovated because of my Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite status. I was underwhelmed by the room; however the river view was exceptional. The property is clean, the bar is very good, and the staff at the LB Café is friendly and efficient.  This was my first visit to Chicago, and I will certainly come back when it’s warmer/."
1316,"I was in town for a work reception and decided to stay at this hotel due to its amenities and location in downtown. Perks of this hotel included,  1) Whole Foods a 5 minute walk away 2) Easy and quick check in (I did arrive at 1am) 3) I got upgraded due to my Bonvoy status to the club lounge and definitely found it worth it. The place has amazing views of the Chicago River and downtown. They have free water bottles throughout the day and breakfast included eggs, toast, cereal and fresh fruit.   My only real downside was the gym, which had 2 Peloton bikes but neither of them were connected so I wasn’t able to use them. Other equipment was great though. "
1317,"The hotel staff were very helpful, valet parking was excellent.  The room had a river view which was great.  The weather was unusually cold for the time of year so we didn't do much outdoors. Would stay here again."
1318,"Convenient location along the river and riverwalk in a mix of attractive older buildings and very contemporary steel and glass towers.  My room viewed the city, and not Lake Michigan, including the Trump Hotel and Tower with its large capital letters reading TRUMP on the side facing the river.  The meeting spaces were adequate and the overall facilities were good.  My room was of a nice size but it did have some background noise from traffic crossing the metal decking of the lift bridge below.   The bathroom should be updated.  The tub floor looked gray and the face of several of the bath tiles was peeling.  Apparently club level rooms have been updated. The hotel is showing a bit of age and dated by its architecture."
1319,"I was here for marathon weekend and it was very crowded. Check-in was fine and room was nice. Very good location near many things in Chicago. Breakfast buffet,  although a little pricey, was good. The concierge lounge at this property was very good and all the people working there were friendly and helpful. "
1320,"Great location, great rooms, great staff. Corner room offering view of river and navy pier. Check in was under staffed and took too long. Able to exit hotel onto river walk. Negative was the cost of parking onsite. Way too expensive!!"
1321,"Wow - I loved this hotel! It's massive, and I attended as part of a large conference, which made it very convenient. It was comfortable and clean. They upgraded my room (as a Gold Bonvoy member) to a MASSIVE suite, which made me feel like a rock-star. I really can't think of any negatives to this place.  Some highlights:  1. Location - right on the Riverwalk, a 5 minute walk to downtown. 2. Great fitness centre - roomy with lots of machines and weights. 3. Luxurious lobby. 4. Clean, modern rooms, comfortable beds, and modern bathrooms. 5. Netflix on all the TVs!  This will be my preferred hotel when I come to Chicago in the future. Thank you!"
1322,"This review is specifically for the café in the hotel. I came here for a conference and that means that the line for coffee and to-go breakfast was always long, but not to worry! The wonderful ladies working at the café are a well oiled machine that give great service with a positive attitude and a smile. They made my long days in the exhibitior hall start in a bright note!"
1323,"I stayed here for a 3 day conference. The room was very spacious and I had a view of the river which was pretty awesome. I love the location of this hotel. It's centrally located and easy to get to all the well know attractions in Chicago.The only small gripe I had about my room was it was right by the elevator. I can here the elevator go up and down in the middle of the night. Other than that, this hotel is great!"
1324,"Our family was treated great during our weekend stay. We used the pool and health club. Both were clean and in good condition. The rooms may be slightly dated, however, for the price, it was a great value and we’d definitely return. "
1325,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now, and I really like it centrality. Walking distance to the miracle mile, easy access to River South and River North area. Can catch the hop on hop off bus tour right out front of the hotel. Excellent choice. Very cool to also watch the Chicago Marathon as the runners pass right by this hotel. "
1326,"This hotel is located right on the river in the middle of downtown.  Very easy walk to Navy Pier and any of the architecture water tours you'd want to take in Chicago.  My room had a great view of the river and city.  The rooms could be updated a little, but weren't too bad.  The gym had a lot of great equipment including a Pelaton bike that I was a bit intimidated to setup and try."
1327,"I stayed here for a conference and it was a great stay from the ease of check in to the spacious room. I had a view of the river and it looked great! The only issues I had was my room was right by the elevator so I can here it go up and down and the check out like was super long. I think scheduling could have been anticipated when you are aware of a large check out process due to groups. Other than that, I love the located of the property as it is centrally located and walking distance to most of the attraction of Chicago."
1328,"Beautiful hotel with excellent facilities. It was American Thyroid assc convention and this was the venue.  Problem started upon check in when the “system” noted our booking was cnacelled.  After haggling, i was given a room.  The booking included wifi and breakfast but the dining area was not informed so the “system” again failed. So our tour leader had to complain again.  Upon check out, thentour leader asked to settle my bill and spelled out my name BUT  the “system “ cant locate my name. When i messaged her my room number then the “system” suddenly had me on the list. The girl in the counter cant answer why it happend.  Overall the stay the bed and facilities are excellent. The management should look at their computer gitches because the team cant explain the fiasco except"
1329,"There is always the temptation to look beyond those ""older"" hotels that are exceptionally well located and try newer properties.  I debated this property versus something newer and opted for the better location.  The hotel, which must be well over 30 years old was fresh and comfortable. There is the odd design element that shows its age (bathrooms). However, we had a spacious room with a view of the river that was functional and comfortable. This is probably a small thing but some hotels can feel pokey based on the size of the corridors. The Sheraton Grand has wide and spacious corridors. making the hotel (which is large) feel more like a boutique hotel.  We found the staff excellent - very friendly and efficient.   Overall an excellent stay."
1330,"Located in downtown. Great place to stay. Rooms are nice, big. I had a river view room and it looked fantastic. Amenities were as per the standard. Concierge service was fantastic and helped me booking and great advice as well. Check in and out was smooth "
1331,Love this hotel. Well located for my office and the rooms are well appointed and newly renovated. Bed was comfortable and shower was great - strong pressure and hot hot water. Gym was great too. Nice equipment including peloton bike and lots of pieces. Bar was busy every evening and worth having a drink at. 
1332,First time visiting Chicago.  Our convention group was booked at the Sheraton Grand.  Happy we were as the location and hotel are excellent. Right on the riverfront so morning exercise walks were great.  Hotel itself it very spacious and comfortable.  We had a corner room which was huge with great views.  Elevators were fastest I have ever experienced at a hotel.  Beds extremely comfortable and staff was great.  Really enjoyed our stay.  Only caveat is the only morning coffee is the Starbucks in the hotel.  I’m not a Starbuck fan and it is expensive as well.  I wish there was a coffee shop or Dunkin near by. Otherwise excellent all around.
1333,"We stayed here for 4 days. The location was fabulous. We like to explore on our feet and this hotel could not be better located. This is a walker or public transit riders dream. The lobby is lovely and the staff could not have been more welcoming. We were greeted by water often when waiting at the concierge for recommendations or help. At check in the staff was welcoming and had some good recommendations. The room on the other hand was small and dark. We got the upgraded view at check in as a surprise bonus but, it doesn’t change the fact that the rooms are disappointing. Clean and neat though."
1334,"The hotel is beautifully appointed and has a great view of the river! Plus you are close to lots of sites and attractions, the only downside is the elevators need more of them waited almost 20 minutes to head downstairs :( "
1335,This was our 1st time staying at the Sheraton Grand Chicago. The location along the river was terrific. My husband’s conference was being held there which made it so convenient. We dined at Shulas steakhouse which was delicious. I also had the buffet breakfast every morning at LB Bistro which started my days off perfectly before I headed to the museums. The room had a perfect view of the Chicago river especially at night when all the buildings sparkled like stars. The room was average in size. It could have used a loveseat instead of one chair. We didn’t get the renovated room that I hoped for but the view made up for it. 
1336,"Stayed here for 10 nights and really couldn't find anything to fault the place on. Nice staff at desk, room was immaculate and recently refurbished. Nice terrace bit by the river. Very pleasantly surprised given the hotel isn't a new hotel. Highly recommend."
1337,Stayed at this hotel 2 weekends ago. Everything was great expect for the fact my credit card was charged and I was never sent a bill. Tried calling and was told they couldn't find my bill. Emailed and was never gotten back to. Absolutely unacceptable.
1338,"A big hotel with a dedicated staff that truly wants to make your stay a great one.  Have to call out Melissa at the desk, Matt at the bar in Shula’s and Paula at concierge.  The Chicago marathon was starting at the time we were to depart and Paula made certain we had a ride set up (at a great price) with someone who knew how to get around the race route. She even checked in during the trip to make certain all was going well! First class!"
1339,Location good. Club room not worth extra cost. Most basic we have ever experienced. Never been in a club  room where a glass of wine is $12plus tax and tip. We should have had a newly renovated room on high floor. Our room was not newly renovated and to use the club room meant we had to go down transfer to another lift to go to the club room. After complaining we were moved to a higher floor.
1340,Stayed for one night and had a great stay. Arrived early and the receptionist realised I’d travelled a long way and kindly let me check in early so I could rest. Room was clean and spacious with great views of Chicago. The rooms are old and probably could do with an upgrade and lick of paint but that didn’t at all diminish that it was a great stay. The location is right next to the Chicago River and a easy walk to all the main areas of Chicago. Definitely would recommend staying here.
1341,"Enjoyed a two-night stay for a conference. Nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about. I really liked the location - I had a view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan from my room. Nice exit onto the river walk from the bottom level. The only meal I ate onsite was at a banquet and the food exceeded my expectations. Easy to check-in and out. Right next to Navy Pier. And since I didn't have to pay (company dime), I have no idea if the value was worth it or not. Everything was as it should be in the room. Overall this review likely didn't help you - but hey good luck finding the right hotel in Chicago. Got plenty of options!"
1342,"Disappointed in Shula Steak House. The music was loud and uncomfortable for a restaurant at 6pm. Had to leave before ordering because of the volume. No other restaurant available in the hotel. Sure, I could have ordered in however not a fan of eating in hotel room."
1343,Great hotel great location right on the Chicago River. We upgraded to a suite which is well worth doing also had a club room so breakfast was included. The rooms overlooking the river have spectacular views of all the buildings lit up at night. The room has every thing you would need for a comfortable stay. it is only a short walk from Michigan Avenue and a 10 minute walk from Navy pier. The staff on reseption were very helpful
1344,"We stayed here one night while in Chicago. I got a very good price and was overall very happy. The hotel is in the center of Chicago on the river. It is in a nice area and you can walk to most places. Just be aware that the parking price is astronomical. It was $60 to SELF PARK overnight. It was in a secure garage but.... I think that is a bit too much. You can park within a block for $25. The room seemed very clean until I went to use my towel and there were brown and black marks all over it. They looked fresh and not stained. GROSS. Other than that, it is a very nice hotel."
1345,"Not impressed. Hotel has a very nice grand entrance. All elevators didn’t seem to be working/running. Rooms very basic. Toiletries limited to cheap shampoo,conditioner and moisturizer. A/c had SERVICE illuminated even after me reporting it. Failed to service room had to request in the evening. Door men extremely helpful and friendly. Lack of charging stations in lobby/lounge area. Needs updating."
1346,"The room I satyed in had a nice river view, but during my stay the construction noise from the opposite river side disturbed me, especially on Saturday morning. The doors to the corridor are everythen else than nois proof and due to some reunion events over the weekend it was very noisy, even in the late evening. The carpets in the rooms are worn out and no longer fashionable: They should be replaced by wooden panels. On the posive side, staff was very helpful and friendly."
1347,The room I stayed at had a partial lake view which was nice.   I was told that it was a recently refreshed room but it still seemed tired to me.   The staff was helpful but the reception desk staff could have been more professional.   They seemed all too casual in their behavior.     The only choice on Sunday for dining was the bar and they had a very limited menu of only cold bites.     It was very conveniently located with many steak houses in walking distance but not a lot of diversity.     The members lounge had limited amenities and services.   Overall a nice hotel but nothing extraordinary.
1348,"Stayed here for a weekend get together with old friends, at a decent group rate. Wonderful location with pleasant, if rather  overpriced, bar and steak restaurant (""Shula's). The lobby is huge with plenty of seating. My room was large and comfortable but no microwave or fridge. It was on a high floor; elevator service was slow. I was sorry not to have a view of the river. The electronic key on the Marriott app didn't always work, so I got a real key from the front desk. All in all, a satisfactory experience."
1349,"I recently went here for a conference and was very pleased with the hotel, the room and all amenities! Nice bed, bathtub, and tv! The staff were pleasant and very helpful. Great access to the city and local food!"
1350,I came here this past weekend and the hotel is on a great location. Everything is in walking distance. You can't come to Chicago and not walk on the River Walk. The Navy Pier is so close and UBER access is great from this location.
1351,"Sheraton Grand is located in within easy walk of Navy Pier, Mag. Mile, several good restaurants and entertainment  . It sits right on the riverwalk with access to outdoor seating and dining. Beautiful view of Navy Pier and the lake from my room on 33rd floor.  Although the hotel was quite busy, there was no wait for the elevator, or for luggage services, when  I stored my luggage, as my room wasn't ready. They did have a room for me by 2:00 ( I was super warly( and I was notified by text.. Nice room, large, comfy bed."
1352,"Had a club level room with a great view of the river, river walk and all the buildings across the river, was fun to watch all the people down below. The room had nice style but was not big. The hotel was crowded and checkin was slow even for high level club members. Parking was very expensive. Uber was the way to get around. The club for breakfast and snack in the late afternoon was out of control on a holiday weekend.. Breakfast had a line down the hall to get in. The afternoon was easier, the help was great and especially RENE, who was Puerto Rican, he made each visit special. So friendly and helpful, be sure to visit with this great guy! You will always have a friend in Chicago. The maids were very friendly also.  All in all the hotel is a nice place to spend a few days in"
1353,"The hotel was situated within walking distance of many great food options.The service provided at check in was prompt and painless especially after a missed flight. Inside the rooms, the decor was modern and clean. Could not really fault it for a 4 star hotel. Would definitely recommend."
1354,"My husband surprised me for our anniversary by booking a great room, with flowers and chocolates to be delivered to our room (in which he also called the number for the hotel to verify as well). When we arrived we did not get either. We were told that the Sheraton online Booking and telephone service are not their company. SERIOUSLY??!! My husband explained that he called the number listed on the website and he was still told by the recption desk that it isnt associates with them. We will NEVER stay here again."
1355,"High priced comfort inn. The hotel is nicely done, some of the staff were rude. The beds were awful and the pillows were so flat I had to fold them up to get any support, called guest services to get firmer pillows, when they were delivered I thought a mistake was made, my husband chased the guy down, those were the firm pillows, looked and felt the same as the crapy ones. The little cafe downstairs serves Starbucks coffee, that was the highlight of this hotel"
1356,"The hotel was nice and the service was fair. The rooms are dated, could use a good renovation. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. I would try another hotel next time, not very worth it for the price."
1357,The location is terrific..near Michigan Avenue and right on the river. All staff super nice and responsive to requests for services. Only things I didn’t like were the food options were not great for vegetarians...the charging of anything in the mini bar or on top of counter gets moved (we weren’t charged it’s just annoying to think if we move something we could be and because of this there was no usable fridge in the room) and the rooms were a bit small and old for the price. Love that it’s dog friendly!
1358,Booked a room with river view.  The room smelled musty and wasn’t cleaned well.  The window was extremely dirty so defeated the purpose of having a river view.  We were moved to a room two doors down and that one was a little worse.  The phone didn’t work and the bathroom was dirty.  We were finally able to move to one of the renovated rooms which I guess there are some of those and it was a little better with new bedding and some furniture.  The lamp didn’t work by the bed but we could see out the window.    Just not what we expected for the price and for a Sheraton.  Scratching this one off the list.
1359,"Took forever to check-in.  Twice, AFTER dinner, we were told our room wasn’t ready.  Then for the next two nights-they NEVER cleaned our room.  Both nights upon return from our meetings we were told oops, sorry, it’s too late to get someone here, we’ll send clean towels.  What?  Where was management?  How is this acceptable for a Sheraton? Would not recommend! "
1360,"Stayed here 10/9 -11.  Very polite front desk staff explained how things run during covid.  I was recognized as an Accor member and am ex platinum.  We were given a 24th floor king room with a nice view of the Hancock building.  Room was very clean with an exceptionally comfortable king bed.  Separate glass enclosed shower and a nice bathroom with shampoo, soap bottles etc.  One robe and two towels were provided with no additional housekeeping for the two night stay.  Extra towels were brought up on request.  In room Keurig coffee maker was appreciated.   The is a nice outdoor seating casual restaurant less than a block away that is open 7 days a week. Location is convienet to walk to most popular dining, shopping etc.   We would definitely stay at this location again. "
1361,"We spent a few nights at the lovely Sofitel in late July while visiting family in the area.  They did an amazing job of instituting in-depth safety procedures without making guests feel uncomfortable or unwelcome--in my experience, this can be a hard mark to hit.  We loved the convenient location and comfortable rooms.  During our stay, we enjoyed both their dining room and bar and noted the spaced out seating to allow distancing and the thorough cleaning of tables after guests departed.  It was a truly delightful stay and I congratulate the gracious staff for both their hospitality and their attention to safety."
1362,"The hotel is pretty nice but it is overshadowed by the high price of parking. The parking is $50 a night, which is very pricey for most budgets. If You plan on coming to Chicago and need to park a car, choose a hotel that offers better parking options."
1363,"Road trip to Chicago during a crazy time in our world. The Sofitel is a beautiful hotel at a reasonable price in a wonderful location. It is a block away from Chicago's Miracle Mile and John Hancock Building. The hotel was clean, room spotless, and large. It was nice and modern. Staff was very nice and accommodating for any request in this difficult time. Highly recommend this hotel!"
1364,"After a long confinement to take care of my parents, we came to this large and beautiful hotel, we were very well received especially by Stefano who helped us so much to make this stay magnificent, we slept in a spacious room with lots of technological equipment, beautiful functional bathroom, incredible breakfast"
1365,"In this trip my friends and me visited Chicago, we really enjoyed it to do, We travel around US and Latin America. We decided to stay in this hotel, i read other opinion and i thought that it will be a good idea.  The hotel could be a little bit expensive but has good amenities, nice view, it has good location and nice resaurant. When we visited Chicago was before thecovid's 19 pandemic."
1366,"I couldn’t be more delighted than with the service we received upon our first stay at this property. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel was clean and well prepped for the unique needs of a traveler during this pandemic. Hotel breakfast was delicious and I wished I would have tried it out first day there, as then I would have ordered it every day. Make sure to have a staff member show you you all of the lights and motorized shade function in the suites as they can be tricky and can seem like they are malfunctioning. You just need a quick tutorial and you’ll be all set. I look forward to future visits to this property. "
1367,"Sofitel Chicago is definitely a must try when you are in the area. With great service, beautiful clean rooms, top notch  bedding, and most importantly delicious food and cocktails.  The location is close to many restaurants and attractions. "
1368,"Sofitel Chicago, without question, certainly has the best housekeeping department in the city.  Whether one is travelling for business or leisure.  Stephano, who is combined Engineering and Housekeeping Director, is the most organized and highly efficient manager that a guest could ever imagine.  As a world traveler, I have not never seen anyone with a versatility who runs a department with attention to every detail, his interest is only what is the guests wish.  Stephano’s ability to handle any situation at the hotel aside from the incredible housekeeping arena “makes this hotel”.  Stephano is known as “MR FIX IT” at the hotel.  After nearly three months of staying at the property, his knowledge and professionalism is beyond one’s highest expectation.  His success, I believe,"
1369,"This was our first stay during COVID and we were impressed by the cleanliness of the room and kindness of the staff. Sanitizer and masks were available, and room service was only upon request. Water bottles were provided in the lobby, and while the restaurant was busy even for to-go orders, it was delicious!"
1370,"This was my first time staying a hotel post-COVID, so I was a little apprehensive about it. However, immediately upon walking in to the Sofitel I was impressed with the measures they'd taken, from glass partitions at the check-in desk to sanitizing wipe dispensers. The common areas are also beautiful, with a luxe look deserving of the price and hotel class. The woman who checked me in was very welcoming, as were the other staff I encountered during my stay.   My room looked great at first glance as well, with upscale finishes and a comfortable bed. But as I started to get settled and take a closer look around, some alarm bells began to go off in my head. I noticed black hairs on almost every surface of the room. From the desk to the bathtub, there was hair everywhere. I'm a"
1371,"I travel a lot and rely on  TripAdvisor, so I will try to provide the info that I look for in a review,  Judging a hotel during COVID is difficult as these are strange times and things are in flux.  That said, we stayed for 5 days (booked through Accor website).  The Accor program only gives you credit when you book directly through them which is pretty unusual and a little stupid, so while I have stayed in many Sofitels and Fairmonts, it doesn't  show on my account.  Check-in was a bit of a cluster. Had emailed the week before to confirm (as the hotel that I had originally booked- the Langham- cancelled and delayed opening until July). Gave my arrival time and requested a high floor.  Called the day before to again confirm and was told we were all set.  Arrived on time (3PM)"
1372,"This week, I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile, and we experienced excellent customer service. I would like to commend Kyle Jackson, Director of Rooms, for his excellent customer service and attention to detail. My stay was during the week of June 12-17, 2020, immediately after the hotel's re-opening due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During these especially difficult times, Kyle came through like a champ! Due to the pandemic, we had to order food to-go from local restaurants. Therefore, we needed a microwave oven, refrigerator, cutlery and plates and needed plates and cutlery. We presented our requests to Kyle, and he promptly arranged to have everything delivered to our room. Each time we needed towels or the trash taken out, or the room cleaned, Kyle again responded"
1373,"Sofitel has wonderful employees, and we are sorry for their loss of wages recently. Chicago’s inability to manage its police force, finances and criminals means we aren’t coming. Hopefully, the city of Chicago can become safe and enjoyable again someday. "
1374," The location and decoration are very good, very safe to get around even at night time, also convenient for dining and shopping. Service is excellent! One of the newest hotels in downtown Chicago. Breakfast is not bad"
1375,Great views of the Chicago sky scrapers and in all the action of shopping districts.  This place was unprecedented...  I thought the staff were friendly and efficient and the room was overall comfortable.
1376,"I have never written a review before. Stayed here recently with my family. I left my watch on the bed and when we returned to the room it was gone. Not wishing to rush to any judgment, I immediately contacted hotel staff and asked for the issue to be investigated. It transpired that house cleaning picked it up and put in with the industrial laundry. Mistakes happen, albeit the particular maid was grumpy because our 13 month old was napping so she couldn’t get into the room earlier. Anyway, the hotel assured me they would “do they right thing”. They haven’t. Their insurers have offered a derisory amount and to buy the exact replacement will cost me 2k more. What my major issue us that the hotel have ignored all emails and allowed the situation drag on. I wasn’t even offered as"
1377,I stayed at this hotel for the night of i got married. we arrived late at night and Andrey was checking us in. he recognize my nationality from my name which is Kazakhstan and after telling that we just got married in that night he upgraded our room to a suit  and congratulated us in our language. after arrived to our room we were surprised by the room and its great view.after some minutes Andrey  surprised us again with pastry and congratulation card which was delivered by the room service. this was made our wedding night unforgettable and we will not hesitate to suggest your hotel to all of my friends and family. Thank you Andrey and sofitel team for this amazing stay.
1378,"great food but you might want to print out your reservation first their credit card system cheated me out of a night showers are pretty slim the liquer was expensive ... its a chinse affair i spent it on new years eve ... dining was great perhaps if you use a credit card have your information on you, i was excited to be in Oprah world"
1379,The Sofitel is a beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood. Our room was modern and comfortable. We had a suite which mead a nice size. There were slippers and robes which was a nice touch. The hotel is very clean. The front desk staff were very friendly. The location is excellent. Lots of restaurants and shopping close by. I will definitely stay here again. 
1380,"Frequent traveler to Chicago for business and pleasure.  Sofitel never disappoints.  Excellent place for business travel as location is close to everything, including Chicago Loop business, which is a short Uber/Lyft or 20 min walk.  Restaurant and bar area are chic and staff outstanding throughout this hotel."
1381,"Located in the northern part of downtown, the area feels a bit more relaxed than hotels on Michigan Ave (2 blocks away) or in the loop.   The area has great restaurants, nice shopping, and it's walking distance to many things.  We walked to / from the Art Institute and  Field Museum.   Well appointed room and bathroom.  "
1382,We enjoyed a brief stay at the Sofitel. It is well-sited for many of Chicago's attractions with many in easy walking distance. The bedoom is spacious. There are pkenty of restaurants and bars nearby as are the shops on the Magnificent Mile and the John Hancock building.
1383,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff.  Charcoal in was a breeze.  Our car was loaded with boxes, a nightstand, bags, and miscellaneous items.  The bellhops surrounded our car and unloaded everything onto carts, then proceeded to get all if it to our room.  Then we had another load of 15 more boxes which were shipped to a friend in Chicago.  That night we picked up those boxes and the bellhops did it again.  The next morning they loaded several loads onto our car.  The rooms were incredibly comfortable.  The location is in the Gold Coast area, so lots surrounding hotel.  We are very grateful to the staff."
1384,"This modern, sleek hotel is located just off Michigan Avenue in an area with great restaurants and shops. The welcome was very warm, with excellent, professional staff who wanted to ensure that we would enjoy our stay. The benefits of the AMEX program were clearly explained and we received an upgrade. The room was spacious with beautiful views of the neighborhood and the bathroom was well laid out, with a separate tub and shower (and nice Lanvin products). The bar has a great atmosphere and excellent staff serving fine cocktails and small dishes. Finally, breakfast is served in the airy and bright restaurant and the croissants in particular are not to be missed. We would definitely stay here again. "
1385,"Spent a night here on our anniversary. It was great. The staff, the room, the location, the amenities and the restaurants were terrific! We had dinner in the cocktail lounge-delightful! And, breakast the next morning in the restaurant. Yummy and relaxing!"
1386,"The check in with Carlos was fast,efficient and Incredibly friendly. He also upgraded our room without asking and all his recommendations for restaurants were spot on. The room was well-appointed and very clean. The whole experience was topped off by free champagne and appetizers in the lobby. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Chicago."
1387,"Loved this hotel! Perfect perfect location! Close to so many great restaurants and bars! Clean room, comfortable bed, bathroom and accessories were wonderful. We were on the 28th floor with great views!  Front desk were quick, efficient, and ever so friendly! Will definitely stay again! Thanks for the great stay!"
1388,"We had a very nice stay at Sofitel. The room was very nice and spacious. Service and attention was A+. Great location within the Magnificent Mile. Close to restaurants, shops, etc. I could definitively stay again."
1389,"I travel a lot to Chicago for work - this is by far one of my favorite hotels. It's easy walking distance to the river, Navy Pier, Mag Mile, and my office.  The environment is fresh and bright, the service was wonderful and the place is just beautiful.  "
1390,"The following are notes from my experience staying in a Prestige Suite:  Closet was small for a suite. Half the closet space of most american standard hotel rooms...in a suite. This is a french closet door, which was very old and worn and kept getting unaligned.  Wifi did not work. The engineer that came by was kind and professional, but 3rd party internet provider had to be called and they could not fix problem as the router was in another hotel guest room.  The Prestige suite has a ridiculously small walk in shower. Smaller than the one at a basic gym locker room. It only fits one adult person and doesn't have enough room for that person to stretch...in a suite that seemed to have been updated with attention to (most) details.  Note: High floors not guaranteed with Prestige"
1391,"Quite sophisticated hotel in Chicago downtown, in a very good position to walk through the Magnificient Mile as well as the main attractions in the city center. It is a modern style hotel, clean and in order, basically it is worth the cost."
1392,"The Sofitel was magnificent indeed.   Perfect location, centrally located to Magnificent Mile as well as the Loop, with many fantastic dining options nearby.   The room was fabulous with the signature feathertop bed and designer toiletries, a lovely size. (Ask for a corner room)  There was an option for housekeeping not to come and clean the room, and you could get $10 back.   Complimentary tea & coffee making facilities for the guests downtown available 24hrs.   We stayed at another hotel on Mag Mile, but would definitely return to the Sofitel in the future.   Highly recommended!  "
1393,"Our stay was in a Superior king on the 18th floor (free upgrade because our room wasn’t ready when we arrived), and the views were gorgeous. The room was very well appointed and had one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on (although there was no top sheet, just a duvet). The rain head shower was glorious but there were some dirty aspects of it (see photos). The chaise had a large stain so we just avoided sitting on it. The thing that really disappointed us was the $20 “amenity fee” that we were charged upon checkout for using the mini fridge in the room (needed to store leftover dinner). I’ve never been charged a fee for using a mini fridge at any hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Overall, the location was terrific and the staff was very courteous. It was that amenity fee"
1394,"My husband and I will definitely visit this posh, beautiful hotel again. From the moment we stepped into the gorgeous lobby, we were impressed. As we approached the reception desk, we were greeted by Eric’s warm, friendly and professional demeanor. He made a great first impression of this property. Our room was spotless, modern and very well appointed with robes, slippers, Keurig machine and a super comfy bed! Bathroom is spacious and classy! Mike, our doorman, was also very friendly and helpful which just added to our positive feelings for this hotel. We highly recommend staying here! "
1395,"As conference co-chair for the second year in a row, we were alarmed when we learned of new management at the Sofitel. With stellar experiences in prior years on every level, accommodations, catering and personnel, we thought we would be starting at Square 1. Not so, the new team elevated our prior experience to even greater heights. Our pre-conference meeting was attended by an army of Sofitel staff with GM Matt at the helm, dedicated to serving every aspect of our experience. They were knowledgeable, professional, accommodating and treated everyone involved at the conference with tremendous grace and respect. We’re coming back again for our sixth year and back to the Sofitel L.A. for our mid-year meeting. Thank you to everyone on the Sofitel Chicago team. You knocked it out of"
1396,"Absolutely very good hotel not only because of location (5 minutes from Michigan Ave) but also because of service, stuff and standard. Room are very good equipped and clean. Excellent bathroom. Very quiet. "
1397,"The hotel is modern.  Located in the city center.  The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The staff is well trained.  There is one, but significant drawback, standard breakfasts at a very high price.  A two minute walk from the hotel you can eat much tastier and half the price."
1398,"You will never do better than SOFITEL for travel accomodations!!! The fine personnel there treat you as a GUEST , that you truly are!  From the Bell Captain on through until Check Out, the treatment is always friendly, professional, efficient,  and very welcoming!"
1399,Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  Needed to change rooms had other minor issues which were handled very well.  Rooms were what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.  Location is prime and can't be beat.
1400,"This hotel is in a great location, just off Michigan Avenue. We booked a Prestige Suite and requested a high floor. It had great views & offered plenty of room for our family of 4.  It was clean, modern and a wonderful location at a fraction of the price of the other 5 star properties nearby.   If you want Magnificent Mile adjacent for a great value, book here. "
1401,"Stayed two nights at the Sofitel Magnificent Mile for a conference. The check-in and check- out experiences were very smooth and so easy. I arrived early and was going to just check my luggage, but they secured a room for me to check in early. The room I stayed in was very luxurious and clean, comfortable beyond belief. Great hotel, great location, great staff!"
1402,"What an amazing stay at the Sofitel Chicago. From the moment we checked in we felt special. The bed oh so comfortable, the small amenities supplied, and my wife loved the Hermes shampoo, condition, lotion, soap, and bath gel. Every person we came across was very friendly and helpful. Great location, great staff, and great room."
1403,"Nothing about this Sofitel experience was less than top-notch.  The property is well-appointed, and the room (a king) was very spacious.  The amenities were excellent, from the gym to those provided in the bathroom.  The staff were quite friendly, and there is no shortage of great restaurants, shops, and bars nearby (but without making the area loud and party-central)."
1404,We booked 4 rooms all on 8th flooring Dec 27 one night stay   Three rooms were ready at 3:30 the 4th two hours later   We out five of the six grandkids in one room I took off the pillow on the longe to give to the kids to lay on.  Here is where I discovered a sick disgusting sight    Food all over never cleaned. This was true on all rooms.  All the said was they gave me my room fee back which is 20.00 For one room   So check your rooms they probably are not cleaned. Or maybe now they might be after I showed the desk pictures 
1405,"We had started out at another nearby hotel but was so disappointed we moved to the Sofitel, where we had stayed for our wedding night 10+ years ago; our stay was as perfect now as it was then.  Our junior suite was fantastic:  incredibly comfortable bed, spacious and luxe bathroom, lovely sitting area with large screen tv, perfectly quiet at night. Added bonuses included free coffee bar (excellent coffee) in the lobby, a fun bar and a very cool lobby decoration.  The location just off Michigan Ave is ideal, close to everything but out of the fray.  As always, it's the service that really distinguished the Sofitel; from the minute of checking in to leaving 4 days later, all the staff were professional, focused on our enjoyment and nice!  Can't say enough good things about our"
1406,kept having problems with the commode not working properly they were fast in answering with maintenance   but very inconvenient going down 20 floors to use the restroom. also they need to air purify the rooms they have pets in so as not to to bother next person in room with allergies no spa on location  server in bar was rude and they do not give back all your change from drinks!! just not a 5 star stay
1407,What a great experience. The overall service was amazing. The concierge Morgan went way beyond to make this trip perfect! I would not hesitate to stay here again. Our favorite place yet in Chicago. Don’t forget to try the restaurant
1408,"A weekend stay, christmas shopping. Very convenient -a 3 minute walk to the Magnificent mile, where you can walk right into the Watertower mall. The motel has a very modern vibe throughout. The room was clean and roomy, the mattress was comfortable and the pillows didn't flatten. The bathroom was large and had a good ventilation system, The shower had easy controls. We stayed on the 7th floor right across fromthe elevator but never heard the noise from them.  "
1409,"Loved this hotel , beautiful , different holiday decor , friendly , helpful staff , clean , nice rooms , perfect for a girls trip !! Great location , easy , safe walk to the Magnificent Mile ! Perfect choice ! "
1410,"Nice, friendly, professional, comfy beds and just all around classy hotel.  Of course, Tripadvisor is just ridiculous and one has to write at least 200 characters, therefore, the Sofitel is nice, friendly, professional with comfy beds.  Classy hotel."
1411,I recently had a fantastic experience with Allan at the front desk. He was so helpful in accommodating my stay I can’t say enough! The 5 star service made the stay more than worth it. I recommend this hotel to everyone. Can’t beat it.
1412,"High luxury hotel! Attended a wedding there...it was really amazing with all those sparkling chandelieres and fabulous service. The restaurant had a large choice of dishes for breakfast, especially continental style. The bed in the room so comfortable with pampering sheets and duvets... Highly recommended!"
1413,Right downtown by Navy Pier and Magnificent mile.  a great locaion to get anywhere in Chicago.  Staff was very friendly and rooms were comfortable and clean.  Evferything wsa great and I would definitely stay here agaim.
1414,Everything good - Nothing negative    Great location (right downtown)  Friendly staff!   Most comfortable bed 😀 and super nice bathroom with nice vanity - room to spread your things out  - good security too!
1415,"Last month, I was tasked with meeting with representatives of high profile companies in Chicago. I booked three rooms at the Sofitel for my team and I. Our meeting went very well and a few of the members of upper management from the companies that we met with chose to join us for a drink at the hotel bar. I would soon learn that this was a mistake. I was throughly embarrassed as our choice of hotel became the butt of the jokes for the rest of the evening. The lobby and common areas were filthy. One of the members commented that they were insulted that we had taken them to the “most glorified motel in Chicago.” Luckily, I didn’t lose our partnership however I’ve learned to be much more careful in selecting my hotels!"
1416,I had a group that stayed at this hotel and they have nothing but good words to say. From check-in to check-out the stay was smooth. They appreciate how accommodating the staff were. And A+ for the breakfast. They loved it. Will definitely refer clients here again.
1417,"Coming in I was excited to stay at the Sofitel but left very disappointed. I had a cool shower on three of my four nights stay. I called the front desk the first night, after 2nd night approached the front desk and they said they would take care of it while I was out, 3rd night called the front desk again - maintenance knocked on my door after I was in bed! He was very nice and worked to correct the problem but I had to get dressed and told him it didn't matter as I was leaving early the next morning.  I really thought I would see at least an adjustment in my room charge but that did not happen when I checked out.  I hate to pile it on (and much of the staff was very, very nice) however the staff at the restaurant made sure I knew they closed at 3, when I stopped in at 2:30 for"
1418,"We stayed at the Sofitel this summer. Check was easy as was check out. Our room was perfect. I’ve stayed at the Sofitel hotel in Paris so I am familiar with the brand, it did not disappoint here in the states.   We also ate at one of the restaurants on site, everything was delicious. The location is prime as well. You will not be disappointed  Would I stay here again? Yes I would and would absolutely recommend it!!"
1419,"We recently stayed on a leisure trip to Chicago to see a friend of ours that is currently in the production of The Niceties.  Morgan, the Concierge at the Sofitel, helped us so much and always had a smile on her face.  From simple directions, to a sensational recommendation of the Purple Pig, we felt very well taken care of and will definitely stay at the Sofitel and call on her expertise again in the future!"
1420,This is a terrific place to stay. Convenient location but off the frenzy of Michigan Avenue.  My room was clean and comfortable and had a terrific chaise on which to sit and work. The bathroom was large with a nice tiled shower and a large tub. Staff was helpful and a newspaper was provided in the morning. Would definitely stay here again. 
1421,What was a great place to eat a Sunday Brunch now is terrible. I mean just awful. Go to Tempo Restaurant down the block.  Sorry to say these words but this is how I feel Maybe they weren’t making money on the old menu but now they will be getting only hotel quest there now
1422,"This was our first stay at the Sofitel Chicago and it was simply wonderful!   From the gracious & friendly check in to the efficient and speedy check out, our stay was memorable.   The hotel decor is modern and very appealing.   Our room was spacious, comfortable and so quiet.  The location was great as Michigan Avenue was close.   This is a place we wish to return to and is highly recommended."
1423,"As much as I like this French chain and their Hotels. Chicago was a failure on every level! Employees just drop the ball left and right. Once you complain, the manager is correcting or trying to correct by some comps just to run into the next situation of failures to start all over again! Biggest disaster is the Front Desk and Bell Staff. Wonder how they got the rating they are riding on. That said, the rooms are nice,....but that's about it!"
1424,"Stayed for 5 nights... room was a really good size and loved the free WiFi. Close to Michigan Ave. breakfasts were good. Staff really friendly and polite. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Loved the Mac n cheese on room service. Home cooked, "
1425,"Prior to our trip, I emailed the concierge and received a prompt reply from Osbaldo.I knew immediately that we had chosen the right hotel. Osbaldo was very informative when it came to finding transportation other than a cab. He checked the opening times for Lincoln Park Zoo as we were going on Columbus Day. Lincoln Park Zoo is a must. It's free and less than a 10 minute cab ride away. On arrival from the UK and feeling tired (we are six hours in front of Chicago) we were greeted as if we were old friends by Eric and Elydia. They made Check-In fun and were informative of the services that were offered. Tea and coffee is complimentary and is available every morning in the lobby. Our room was on the 23rd floor and was immaculate and a very good size.  We had a huge bed and a chaise"
1426,"After staying at a disappointing hotel booked for my conference last year, we vowed to find a hotel in magnificent mile that gave us the best Chicago experience, and the Sofitel definitely delivered. From the warm welcome by the staff to the absolutely incredible views, to the turndown service and meals at both cda and le bar, there wasn’t a single aspect of our stay that wasn’t executed perfectly.   I have never stayed at this particular chain before, but my experience was on par with stays at five star hotels. From now on, Sofitel is going to be at the top of my list when staying in Chicago or any new city."
1427,Great location with superb service and accommodations all with a distinctly European influence and ambiance. All this in a good way you. You won’t regret staying at this upscale property. Whether walking or using mass transit this is where you will want to be.
1428,"Stayed here whilst attending the GBTA conference in August. Lovely hotel, friendly staff, great location. Not a massive fan of the breakfast. Rooms were really nice and big, very well equipped especially for someone who is travelling on business. Would stay here again!"
1429,"The hotel is among the pricy ones, but you do get a lot in return - so we can highly recommend the place!   On the positive side: - location could not be better, two blocks away from the Magnificent Mile and a 5 min stroll from the metro station Chicago  - very friendly staff - good breakfast - comfy and clean rooms with a very „new“ feel to it (not even scratches on the walls)  Potential for improvement: - the gym could use a refurbishment and does not have any daylight - during our stay, only two out of four elevators were operating, leaving guests with quite some waiting times when trying to go up or down  We would definitely come back!"
1430,We recently stayed at the Sofitel for our anniversary.  Upon check in we were warmly greeted by the staff.  We found our room and got settled in.  Sadly we found undergarments in the closet that did not belong to us and we had to have them removed before we could settle in completely.  The room was nice we had 2 beds and an adequate view.  The cable was out more than we could count on the rainy days we were there which made it challenging.  Thankful one of us had a book to entertain us.  We enjoyed the closeness of the hotel and spent what time we could away.
1431,"I stayed in this property ten times in the last 8 years.  All the stays were very good.    Unfortunately, my last stay was not at all as good as the pat stays at Sofitel Chicago.  Too many issues during my stay which really ruined my 3 nights at the property.  Food quality has dropped and housekeeping has rooms for improvement.    I conveyed my concerns to management, but it was too late, as our last night was really terrible and ended our vacation on a bad note.  I hope the hotel's management could take back this property to its better days."
1432,"The Sofitel is in a great location for walking Michigan Ave, great restaurants and shopping nearby. It's close to the north end of the strip, so perfect for walking all the way down the Magnificent Mile. Our room was clean and bright, with a big bathroom. Service was excellent, valets helpful, check-in was quick. In warmer weather, there's a nice area to sit outside and have a drink. We tried excellent restaurants within walking distance...Fig & Olive and Bistronomic. The famous Gibsons Steakhouse is also within walking distance."
1433,"I stayed two nights at the Sofitel Magnificent Mile for a conference. My check-in and check- out experiences were smooth and easy. I got there early and was going to just check my luggage, but the front desk person secured a room for me to check in early. The room I stayed in was clean, comfortable and luxurious. Great hotel, great location, great staff!"
1434,"With a strikingly modern building located close to the Magnificent Mile in midst of a nice neighborhood, this hotel should have all it takes for a top rating. And indeed the rooms and bathroom leave little to be desired, both aesthetically and functionally. However, service is erratic, to say the least. Next to Vernon, the competent, personable concierge, I encountered both a female assistant manager as well as a doorman who definitely do not do the hotel proud. And no apologies forthcoming!"
1435,"Very well located, fancy lobby and comfy room. The problem is the breakfast: the service was a mess, complet lack of management, over 20 minutes just to get your order. But even worse is the fact that whem I booked the room the breakfest was included, although NOBODY at the hotel was able to tell me what could I ordered without aditional charges. It´s not about the money but if something is included should be Crystal clear at the menu what to order in this case. Summarizing, take your breakfast elsewhere and enjoy the hotel. By the way, the housekeeping is very well done."
1436,"Fantastic hotel and great facilities, an absolute gem. The selection for breakfast was excellent. Room service was also very tasty. All staff seem to be happy to work here and always smiling.  Thank you for the great hospitality."
1437,"Great location  Great Room  Great Service  Great Drinks  Rooms are stunning I was on the 25th floor in a corner room with a view of the city, bed is very comfortable, desk services were outstanding!!!!  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel and look forward to my next visit"
1438,"Our stay at the Sofitel was wonderful. Beautiful hotel, clean comfortable rooms and a great location. Easily walk to most of the highlights Chicago has to offer. Staff is courteous and friendly. Le Bar is classy and great for sitting by the window and people watching. The views from the room are spectacular. Wouldn’t hesitate to go back. "
1439,"The room was gorgeous.  A bit of inconsistency upon check in.  We were told one thing, our friends told something completely different and we came on the same Travelzoo promotion.  Service in the breakfast area bordered on ridiculous.  Food was tasty but overly priced.  I would come back again however."
1440,"amazing stay with lovely staff in reception , hk are super nice and the food is amazing woooooow , ill recomend this hotel to my people . thank you all the staff for making me happy during my whole stay"
1441,"My coworker and I are nurses currently assigned at McCormick Place on the Covid-19 unit. After a long shift we decided to stay downtown and not drive back to the suburbs. We called ahead to check in. Asked if we can get a room on a higher floor with a view, I did mention we're nurses.  Upon walking into our room we were pleasantly surprised that they upgraded us to a gorgeous suite on the 31st floor. Very clean, huge, 2 bathroom suite with a view. Great service and friendly staff."
1442,The room was big and clean with a great view of the lake and the Navy Pier.  Raquel the clerk at the front desk was very friendly and courteous and gave us exceptional service. We will definitely go back.  Thank you 😊
1443,The room was huge and has a beautiful city and river view. I loved the very complete gym which even had smoothies to have after the workout and flavored waters. (I was there pre-covid). The bar on main level had very yummy drinks and the bartender was nice. 
1444,"The hotel itself and staff are good but they are barely enforcing COVID safety protocols.  I'm local and needed a place to stay while my apartment was getting repaired (flood) and I was so pleased when this hotel had affordable rates for this extended weekend. I guess I'm getting what I paid for, because barely any guests are wearing masks.  I am only leaving my room to get food twice a day, and each time, there are large groups directly in front of reception without masks, and other groups scattered in the lobby and walking around, not eating/drinking, but completely maskless. They say only 2 per elevator, but they still have the elevators set to pick up from multiple floors. At one point a 6th person was trying to enter the elevator and I had to get out. I have even asked a"
1445,My husband and I stayed at the Swiss to give the kids something to do. They had an amazing time. I was impressed with the front desk representative Lanette Silas. She was hilarious the kids loved her and she made sure to give us great tourist attractions for our stay.
1446,"Location is excellent: 5min walk to the Millennium park, 5min walk to Architecture river cruise tour, 15min walk to 360 Chicago observation desk. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. Also there are restaurants in the hotel. Rooms: I highly recommend you to choose river-view room: it really takes your attention. You’ll see skyscrapers, river and city life - it’s really cool. Bed and willows are very comfortable, bathroom is big: there is shower cabin and bath both. Wi-fi works excellent. Some information: Breakfast is not included - you should pay $50 per person. There is “fast” parking zone in front of the main door - you can stop there for taking your luggage from the car and that’s it."
1447,"The staff is welcoming! If Nicole is not already employee of the year she needs to be ASAP. We are greeted with bright eyes and smiles underneath masks. The room has a beautiful view, desk to get work done, and a lounging area. Swissôtel for the win!"
1448,Had a great stay. Olivia Miller checked us in and was amazing. She helped us upgrade to a suite that had amazing views of the lake and river. Huge bathtub. So much room. We ordered food and had lots of room to eat. Bought tickets in advance for the field museum and art institute. Very few people inside. Everyone wore masks. Felt very safe. We are a family of 6 we got a suite with adjoining room. It was lovely. Would stay again. Thanks again to Olivia made our stay great instead of just two small hotel rooms 
1449,Our awesome experience began at check in with the exceptional customer service provided by Quiance. He really made us fell welcomed and from here our expectations were exceeded. The suite and two queen bed rooms were beautiful.  The beauty and elegance of the rooms were only exceeded by the screams of excitement of my 16 year old and her three companions as they entered their suite! The rooms were impeccable and the staff were courteous and efficient.
1450,This is a really nice hotel. The rooms are very clean and the attendant Maria and the runner Mari helped us out with our iron. They also gave me feed back on my makeup which I appreciated. Thanks for the great service ladies. Now the parking structure is a whole different talk show! It was 60.00 overnight and the structure is a nightmare. But other than that everything was great. 
1451,"This is our new favorite hotel around the Riverwalk. After a horrible experience at the LondonHouse, we are so glad that we made alternative arrangements at the Swissotel. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming and the rooms were lovely with stunning views of the river. Highly recommended!!!!"
1452,"Our hotel at the Swissotel Chicago was great! The lobby was beautiful, with friendly staff and social distancing rules in place. The view of the river from my room was also stunning! Great fitness center with a wide range of machines and cool view of the city. Great location downtown, easy to site-see and get around. Would recommend!"
1453,"We noticed garbage on the floor and dust bunnies and cobwebs on the ceiling. This is in the Premier Corner Room, with a view. It is unfortunate that we have to write a review to bring this to light but after notifying the front-desk we were kept waiting on the manager. We were told that the manager would see us, but we were kept waiting. We were told a final cleaning was done before check-in, but look at the photos. They prove otherwise. It is unfortunate that such an expensive room, during the COVID-19 pandemic, where environments need to be clean and sanitized, weren't."
1454,"This was the second hotel that we stayed my friends and me in Chicago, we decided this hotel for the architecture, luxury rooms, good location. we really loved this place, you have everything nearby.   We recommend it 100%."
1455,"Enjoyed my brief stay at the Swissotel.  Great location if you want access to the river walk, lakefront and Michigan Avenue.    Rooms are very large and comfortable.  Did not try the onsite restaurant but it looked nice.  Would definitely stay here again."
1456,"Very last minute, I had to book a full room block and a suite for my wedding weekend during Covid and the amazing team at the Swissotel made it all happen within a few days! They helped me through everything and even put together a Rehearsal Dinner before my wedding that fit my budget and was in the best event space with incredible views (the food was great too!). The events and booking team were on top of everything and were an absolute PLEASURE to work with. When my new husband and I came back to our suite there was a beautiful desert spread waiting for us. I cannot thank them enough for everything they did. The suite I stayed in was simply incredible and very clean. The hotel staff was so kind, helpful, and efficient. I honestly cannot wait to stay here again. I would"
1457,"I booked a room here through Hotwire for the 4th of July weekend. I was excited because I've always seen the outside of the hotel, pointed out in architectural tours. However, I had a disappointing stay.  I don't know why it's considered a 4-star hotel. I didn't see anything special about it.  I stayed there as Chicago started reopening. The hotel didn't reinforce the use of masks in public spaces. I saw countless people walking up and down the lobby without a mask without being bothered at all.  Check-in was easy and I was told that there was no room service, which I actually appreciated. On the other hand, they'd give me a $10/day credit.  I got cleaning supplies from a nearby CVS. The room wasn't as clean as I'd expect during a pandemic. There was hair in the bathroom, and"
1458,"We got to our room yesterday and there was an empty soap wrapper  in the  middle of the floor, rings on the sink in the bathroom, and the  toilet seat was dirty. The room   had been barely cleaned. You would think that at a time like this the hotel  would at least do the bare minimum to keep things cleaner seeing that COVID is still around. They're obviously not taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of their guests by keeping the rooms clean.  If Lori didn't block everything off we definitely would have gone somewhere else."
1459,"Booked a double queen with a city view room. Was able to see all the way to Soldier Field and the Field Museum. Great view of the sailboats on the lake also. Good location right by the Riverwalk and Millennium Park. We also walked to Navy Pier and Water Tower Place. Room was a good size with a large bathroom that had separate shower and tub. Also had a desk, huge television, easy chair and ottoman. Came with a coffee maker and mini fridge. No microwave.  Hotel staff very professional. One of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed at. Never heard any noise in the hallway or another room. Because of Covid they only clean every 3rd day but the room was spotless when we got it and also per policy now the room is unoccupied for 48 hours prior to your visit. I would highly recommend"
1460,"I came to Chicago at end of end of July/beg of Aug 2020.  I stayed in two different hotels— Cambria for 3 nights and then Suissotel for a week.    My experience at Suissotel was great!  The service is incredibly responsive. In particular I have to comment Craig, from the “front office” (I wish I had gotten his last name), who was incredibly accommodating. The housekeeping staff seemed professional and left my room fresh and clean (when I stayed, the policy was to clean every third day, so as to reduce COVID risk).    Excellent location.  I walked to Grant Park, the Art Instiute, kayaking and the lake, and conveniences like Whole Foods (not to mention a short jaunt to sip some wine by the river).   The bathtub was long, the water pressure in shower was great, fridge was super"
1461,"We had a FANTASTIC stay in one of the corner suites and would highly recommend. The views of the river and Lake Michigan were amazing and the special treats we ordered from room service were spectacular! A great, romantic, staycation here in Chicago - just the thing for a special treat in these Covid times."
1462,"I have used this property multiple times for work and personal trips. I have never been disappointed, the property is clean and spacious. It's in a great location, you can walk most places and you feel safe!  The meetings and conventions staff were so helpful and flexible, by far one of the best service hotels I have worked with! The go above and beyond not only for the event staff, but for my attendees too. The food is outstanding, not your average banquet food, my team was really impressed.    The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. The sleeping rooms were good size, clean and updated. Each room has a good view of either the river, lake or the park. I don't have any complaints, I would recommend this property to everyone whether its a personal or work trip!"
1463,"The hotel room was clean and the view is spectacular. It is conveniently located so that you can walk most places and leave your car parked. The price for guest parking is outrageous and getting into and out of the lot is ridiculous. The worst part of our stay was walking through the drinking and smoking on both nights that we were there. On Saturday night, we had to maneuver through groups of people all over in the front of the hotel. I would think that the hotel could have security presence so that guests could get into the front doors without wading through the “party.” When we were leaving the hotel at about 8:30 the next morning, the garbage from the night before had not even been cleaned up. Liquor bottles and food wrappers were all over the ground. There was even a pile"
1464,"We go to Chicago twice a year for a long weekend.  We just returned from that weekend. Here is what we found at the hotel.  There was no maid service unless you called for it.  Thats not bad but when you called they didn't always show up.  The parking garage cost $60 a day and the electronic entry and exit system never did work correctly.  Three of the four times we need to get into the garage, they had to send someone out to the gate and overide the system.  Three of the four times we were to leave the garage, the gate would not work and people we lined up in the garage waiting for someone to come let us out.  You are so far underground that the phones won't work, so one person had to go to the elevators and go upstairs and get the person.  The reception staff were rude at best"
1465,This hotel is so good for a getaway from stress! I stayed 2 days and they met my needs answered all my questions this was my view and it totally relaxed my whole system!  Highly recommended the area has a lot to offer from food to tour hot places!
1466,"Raquel is a great person who does speak Spanish in the hotel, she helped me and my father to check-out on June 28th and also on July 4th and was there to handle any problems/issues. The view on the 18th floor and room 1820 had a great view, and also the 11th floor and room 1116 had the view as well"
1467,I travel quite frequently for work and stayed countless nights at different hotels from all around the world. My stay at The Swissotel was an unforgettable experience. This was my first time to The Swissotel in Chicago. The atmosphere was inviting the rooms including the great views of the Chicago skyline as well as the river walk was breath taking. What really got me was the service I received there. Especially from this one individual who worked at front desk. If I remember correctly the name of this employee was Harper. I was having a bad from my flight getting delayed for 4 hrs to my luggage getting lost at the airport. So When I arrived at the hotel I wasn’t in the best of Moods but that all soon changed when I met Harper. Her inviting smile Along with her Mannerisms were
1468,"From the amazing interior to the spectacular views from the room this hotel is the only one i will stay at while in Chicago.... Lanette,Q,and will at the front desk are so knowledgeable and make you feel like family when staying here....  Customer service was exceptional... Special Thanks to Lanette for making my stay above and beyond the expected."
1469,"Some of my family stayed here while they were visiting from out of state, and they had a wonderful stay.  The staff were professional and courteous, and checked in my family swiftly and with no problems.  The rooms were spacious and the beds were quite comfortable, and room service was prompt and accurate.  The location is great, right in downtown Chicago near the Loop and several amenities (restaurants, museums, shopping, etc.).  Some rooms offer a beautiful view of the lake, while others offer a great city view."
1470,"Let me start by saying that I was so looking forward to our stay at the Swissotel Chicago - for a very special occasion. And it was off to a great start when the bell man greeted us and escorted us to the front desk. But that was the end of our pleasant experience with Swissotel, even though I had called in advance to let them know this was a special occasion. We were greeted at the front desk by a cold and unwelcoming individual named Nicole Thompson. She was horribly rude and unfriendly. When I inquired about the bill because I was surprised it was more than anticipated from my online reservation, she seemed bothered with my questions and made me feel like I was being problematic, instead of just trying to get clarification. We left the front desk feeling very unwelcome and it"
1471,Arrived about an hour or so before check in & I felt as if we were forced into an upgrade otherwise we’d get a room with full beds (even though I was booked a king) I also felt like I was deceived by the upgrade I was told we’d be upgrading to face navy pier however we were not So we had to room change. But when we arrived to the new room it was dirty. Bathroom was not cleaned and previous guest had left things behind. Which made me question the cleanliness of the whole room. Also I was not told of urban fee or what was included so did not get to utilize any of the inclusions with it. When I Contacted the property w my concerns and I was told I’d be receiving a call back however I never received a call back. 100% disappointing. would not recommend 
1472,Very comfortable king size bed. TV was large with a lot of channels. You can pay extra to rent movies still in theaters. Great view. The river view is magnificent and even if you have a city view it’s very nice. Great location. Very clean which is important.   They do charge extra for a microwave which I think is standard in most hotels but apparently not in a luxury hotel. I guess that’s really my only gripe so have to say I enjoyed my stay.
1473,"Decided to stay downtown for my wife's birthday. Found a great rate at Swissotel. Every staff member we encountered was so friendly and helpful. When checking in the front desk attendant attempted to upsell us on a better room, she was very polite,  but we were on a budget, and declined. I thought that would put us in a room facing a brick wall, however we had the most wonderful view of Navy Pier. The bed was amazing, the bathroom was spotless. It would have been a perfect stay, had it not been for the couple next door that fought for at least 2 hours. My wife ended up calling the front desk so that we could finally get some peace. Checkout was super easy, we just dropped the keys in the dropbox. Definitely willing to give Swissotel another shot."
1474,ShanLa H . And Jordan helped me at the front desk even after shift change they were willing and ready to assist me.   Along with Ms Garrett ( who diligently provides the same services after hours ).  Seriously you made my stay very warm and comfortable and plan on staying here exclusively when in Chicago 🌞
1475,"Whenever I am in Chicago, I always try to stay at the Swissotel downtown. I have stayed there on 6 occasions and have never had a bad experience. The staff is always professional and accommodating and the dining and lounges are second to none. I will definately stay there again!"
1476,"Reservations through Groupon discounts worked flawlessly for check-in and we acquired rooms on the 25th and 28th floors. The desk staff were great both at check-in and throughout our stay whenever we had a question.   The rooms were clean and spacious with nice bathrooms. There wasn’t a place for us to play cards or another game in the hotel, so we eked out some room on a table, a couple stools and the bed in one of the rooms.   The location is phenomenal as it is directly above the fantastic Riverwalk and two blocks from the DuSable Harbor where a lot of nice yachts are moored. Behind it is Lake Shore East Park while three blocks away are the start of Maggie Daley Park (great for children) and Millennium Park where Cloud Gate (The Bean) is located. The biggest issue is figuring"
1477,"Great location, comfortable room, nice view but expensive. Room rate per night could be more competitive, but the issue lies more on the restaurant and bar that are totally overpriced, which is a shame when you travel for business (with less time/opportunities to ""escape"" the hotel)."
1478,"This is our go-to hotel when staying in Chicago.  I'm rarely disappointed.  This last trip was one of those unfortunate rare times.  All-in-all everything was good.  The only issue was finding a dirty sock from a previous guest under the drapes in the room.  Knowing that this is not a common experience here, I am willing to forgive, but it's why I couldn't rate this as a 5 for this trip."
1479,"The Swissotel on Wacker Dr in Chicago is a fantastic hotel.  The staff is friendly and professional. The rooms are great, we had a wonderful view from our room.  I will stay again and again.  The rooms are clean, the shampoo and lotion are the best."
1480,"Updated modern feel. Very clean. Beautiful view from the fitness center on the 43rd floor facing Navy Pier. Would definitely stay here again! The service was great, love the pool table in the lobby bar area."
1481,Huge thanks for the entire Conference and Banquet staff.  I'd specifically like to point out James Jenkins.  He was absolutely exceptional.  I can't forget CJ and the rest of the staff.   Every staff member in the conference area was always willing to bend over back to help us out.  You don't find that often when an entire team works together so well.
1482,"After recently completing a corporate program at the property I wanted to specifically call out the banquet staff for the incredible job they do.  From James to CJ, they responded to all of our needs without hesitation.  We look forward to coming back next year."
1483,"I stayed at the Swissotel for the first time during the weekend of Aug 9th to the 12th for my birthday weekend, and I have to say I was very impressed. The room itself, was amazing. The hubby and I stayed in the lifestyle suite and it was awesome. The room was nice and big. Loved the 2 bathrooms, and the big tub. One of the best parts of the suite were the views from our room. We could see millennium park from one window, and a river view from another. The views were amazing. My only con is that when we would come in late, it seemed to be a lot of foot traffic on the outside of the hotel, from other guests friends who didn't stay there, and not a lot of security. Other than that, we had a pretty amazing stay, and would definitely stay here again. The location, the proximity to a"
1484,"I stayed at Swissotel for work this past week. My room was clean and comfortable; I slept really well each night despite being very close to the elevator. We had meetings every day and the conference rooms were very cold in most cases. If traveling here for meetings, I’d recommend dressing in layers so you can stay warm throughout the day. Meeting rooms were spread out across several floors and at first it was confusing to navigate but by the last day we had figured out where everything was and when it was best to use the escalators vs. the elevators and vice versa. On the topic of elevators - that would probably be my only complaint. The elevators work by programming in your desired floor and then you are assigned an elevator. Unfortunately a few times we pressed the floor we"
1485,The view of the river and pier from the hotel was nice. The staff was friendly and attentive.The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The water from the shower spilled out onto the floor. The hotel fees and price of parking were outrageous! 
1486,James Jenkins was AMAZING.  There were times that our group really depended on him for changes and he came through with prompt exacusions of asked for items.  Highly recommend this facility with James team excellent performance.
1487,This is a shout out to Virginia from the hotel staff at the Swissotel in Chicago. I left a pair of Bose wireless headphone in the gym (great gym by the way). Fully expecting them to be gone forever I decide to call the lost and found department to see. To my surprise they where recovered. Thank you Virginia!!   If you find yourself in Chicago for business or pleasure I recommend staying at the Swissotel.
1488,Superb attention to detail and spectacular views. Definitely worth the up charge to get a room with a river view  on  a top floor.  Service was phenomenal. I will be returning next time I'm in Chicago and will be checking for your locations during travel.
1489,Nice hotel. Great location. Had a suite  with connecting room for co workers. Bad idea!!! Suite’s all wrap around the elevator which never stops and has a horrible rattle!!!!   They turn off the elevator form 10-7. Supposedly. Horrible!!!!!They did not clean our room until I called and requested after the third day!! Very disappointed. 
1490,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel while attending a conference that was being held there. The hotel was beautiful and the customer service was very good. The conference facilities were very nice. The room was clean and comfortable. I also loved the aroma of the Purovel toiletries in the room. The location was amazing with beautiful views of the city, lake, pier and river. It’s easy to walk around and explore the city from this location, or catch a bus or boat tour."
1491,"The staff at the Swissotel on Wacker Drive in Chicago are highly trained hospitality professionals.  Our room was awesome, the beds are comfortable, very clean environment.  Bathtub and separate shower.55 inch TV.  2-3 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Riverwalk. 10 min walking distance from State St.  "
1492,I was in need of a lunch last minute for a client meeting at their Arosa room.  He was a tremendous helper and even arranged delivery to the room for me! He’s helped me in years past too and always goes above and beyond! Thanks Michael!
1493,"We stayed here one night for the dental convention at McCormick Place.  We had a nice experience.  Great location.  Our 18th floor room had excellent views, nice size, comfortable bed, large TV.  Quick check in, easy check out.  Great price.  No complaints here!  Overall very satisfied."
1494,"Here for Dental Midwinter conference.  We were greeted with the very friendly Dinah.   After day one of our meeting we enjoyed cocktails made by Donny... not only were his drinks amazing, he had such a great personality.  Can’t wait to come back for happy hour."
1495,"I was in town for a conference and enjoyed my stay at the Swissotel. Front desk staff were very nice and I was able to check in early. My room had great views of Lake Michigan and my room was much larger than I expected for Chicago. I also enjoyed the creative fruit water in the lobby. Only complaint was that the elevator situation was a mess. Constantly had to wait for an elevator only to find it completely full. Then, if you were in a full elevator it still stopped at every floor. Fun."
1496,"They ruined our celebration for our 6 year old child by giving us the wrong information regarding their pool. The day we booked it they said they have a pool, the day of our visit they said they haven’t had one in 2 years. When we asked for compensation staff said “ there is nothing we can do” and gave us the wrong email address to contact reservation or Managment complaining about what happened. On top of it, we felt blamed by them making statements like how couldn’t we have known and asking for proof that staff gave us the wrong information. No ownership, not accommodating, defensive. We will not be going there again even though we have been their customers for 10 years now."
1497,"Thermostat was broken, bathtub was dirty, had an issue with the tv only getting one channel.  Called the front desk and they could not have possibly cared less.  I would have expected that from a 2 star hotel, but at this level, service is the name of the game and they don’t even try.   Stay at a Marriott or a Hilton - your money will be better spent."
1498,"We had a great time. The lake view room was spectacular. The room was clean with a large washroom and big screen TV. The rooms were quiet. The fitness room had more cardio and weight machines than any other hotel I've visited, lots of dumbbells too, and offered Granny Smith applies and lemon and cucumber water. Very nice! It was clean and well kept. The staff were great. In particular our hostess Ruth gave us all the information we needed, recommended a great restaurant and ensured we found our way around town. Outstanding and attentive service with a smile! You can always find a good hotel, but I would come back just for the great service."
1499,"Hotel on the river in the center of downtown. Close to many attractions in Chicago. Clean, very nice service. Beautiful views from the rooms of the City and Navy Pier. A large gym and two restaurants."
1500,"This is the 5th downtown Chicago Hotel we have done a 2-night stay at, in the past 2 years. All others had annoying issues of one sort or the other; but Swissotel's service, accommodations, location, and comfort; has been the best so far!  Highly recommend a ""River View"" suite. "
1501,"We just stayed 2 nights at Swissotel for my husband's college reunion trip. It is a beautiful building, inside and out. Great location, great service, great view. We loved everything about it and would definitely stay again. "
1502,"I love the Swissotel!  The people are always very friendly and the accommodations are wonderful! The rooms are spacious, comfortable and the views from almost every room are wonderful!  I have been a guest at this hotel multiple times and have never had a bad experience!"
1503,"Great hotel that is in a prime location with beautiful views. Parking is ridiculously expensive. The charge for parking was approx. 2/3 of the price of the room which is outrageous. Try the hot chocolate, it is amazing"
1504,"In 2018 we found the Swissotel Chicago Santa Suite by happenstance.  We were staying at another hotel and visited the Santa Suite with our one year old granddaughter.  It was amazing!  We had such a great time, we had to book rooms at Swissotel Chicago for 2019.  We were not disappointed.  We booked an Elf Suite with an adjoining room that accommodated our family of six very comfortably.  Walking into the suite, my granddaughter (now two) was awestruck!  She ran into the room, hugged the reindeer decoration and jumped on the bed.  Her reaction was everything I had hoped it would be!  The decorations, coupled with the beautiful city scape, was a sight to behold!,  Later that evening, we went up to the 41st Floor Santa Suite.  There is no better way to see Santa Claus than this. "
1505,I visited the bar during a recent conference.  My experience was terrific thank you for your top notch service Mr. Demetrie Jones you and your staff are a wonderful example of elite customer service continue the excellent work.
1506,Staff is always friendly and excellent. The corner rooms offer amazing views.  Great upkeep of the facility and my rooms are always very clean.  Close walk to Navy Pier.   The Palm restaurant is attached to the hotel which is convenient.  
1507,"We frequently fly into Chicago for trips. I have stayed in multiple hotels all across downtown and West Loop. This hotel by far has been the best in cleanliness, hospitality and amazing views. They even have a green eco friendly house cleaning where you can receive $10 day credit. It is the perfect location by the downtown river and navy pier. Sharifa, at the front desk went above and beyond finding me a toothbrush when I arrived, saving me a snowy trip out to CVS. We will definitely come back and stay here."
1508,Victoria and Terik were absolutely incredible!!! From the check in Victoria was so sweet and got us into an amazing room with a rad view. She answered all of our questions and was a so professional! We loved it here that we decided to stay another night! Terik handled the seamless transition and helped ensure everything was the way we wanted!  These two amazing young individuals are what every hotel hospitality should dream to be! Very polite and professional but most importantly happy!  Definitely be coming back here!
1509,Nicole T gave the BEST front desk service. Super friendly and considerate! Went out of her way to accommodate me during my stay. Hotel is very nice and gym is great. Food it amazing. Highly recommend!!!!
1510,"We wanted a hotel downtown within walking distance of Millenium Park (since we arrived from Indiana via the South Shore Line) and got a good deal through Hotwire, which placed us in the Swissotel.  We were impressed from the get-go.  We were able to check in early, the room was clean and spacious, and staff was very friendly.  My daughter was disappointed that there is no longer a pool on the premises, but the fitness area that replaced it is very large with nice, up-to-date equipment.  The views from both the fitness area and the guest rooms were great.  My daughter ended up leaving an item in our room after check-out.  We contacted the hotel and the item was sent to us via UPS very efficiently, within just a few days.  Overall great experience and would definitely stay here"
1511,"My trip to Chicago was for the purpose of uniting with my fiancé. She reside from Star the State of Louisiana. And I reside in the State of Ohio. It was at the Swissotel Hotel that I proposed to her at The Palm Resturant. The staff helped my out the great moment together. The Hotel Staff including Nicole, Solomon we’re great in providing excellent 5-Star Service for me and my soon to be wife. I just want to say to anyone who is looking for a reasonable hotel to stay at. You need to stay at the Swissotel you will not regret it. Dr. Sean A. Crowley, Sr."
1512,"Right off the bat, any hotel that charges a ""mandatory"" resort fee, not a tax, gets dropped down 2 stars in my book.  When the excuse for the fee is ""justified"", in the condescending manner that Manager ""Craig"" did when questioned about it, adds insult to injury. This property calls its resort fee and ""Urban Experience"" fee, which I guess is supposed to be a slice of Chicago living, but charging for shoe shines, local and long distance calls, laundry,  a Smoothie during night owl hours, coffee and tea in the lobby is a farcical rip-off...but according to ""Craig"" it is coming to other hotels in Chicago (which I guess makes it right)....why not just raise your price to cover your costs instead of these specious fees - especially for someone like me that actually lives in Chicago"
1513,"Weekend getaway to Chicago and the wife has always wanted to try the Swissotel. Location is about 4 blocks east of Michigan Ave. We were placed in the premier Lakeview comer suite on the 29th floor (2904) that offered stunning views of the city, river, the lake, and Navy Pier. The small hallway from the door to the room itself is a nice touch and adds to the privacy feeling. The bathroom offers great views even when you’re doing your business on the toilet. The bed was great. Sweet spot between firm and soft. Slept like babies.   The fitness center on the 43rd floor is great. Very clean, well lit and offered awesome views as well. Had a lot of equipment and was much larger than your typical hotel gym.   Harper at the front desk was great. Very friendly, very warm, and clearly"
1514,"We got a great last minute rate for a beautiful large room, with two beds and an incredible view of Navy pier and the lake. Staff was wonderful, especially Victoria who helped to check us in. We were slightly disappointed that the pool was removed, but it has been replaced with a beautiful fitness center. Highly recommend this very solid hotel."
1515,"My husband had to go to a conference at a neighboring hotel in Chicago in November and asked if I'd like to join him for a short trip.  I tried to book a night at the other hotel that he was staying at (where the conference was) and they wanted to charge us almost double for another night, so we told them we'd look elsewhere.  The Swissotel came up on Google Maps as being pretty much right next to it, so I booked us a room there.  I was NOT disappointed!  The lobby was beautiful and the staff was very friendly and helpful.. they even showed us how the elevator system worked (which was the first time I'd seen anything like the system they use.)  Our room was clean and comfortable with a great view.  The parking garage between the two hotels gave us an opportunity to discover"
1516,"Swissotel Chicago is tucked away, but don't miss it! Convenient, lovely, and friendly! Accommodations were convenient, staff was friendly and helpful, and there was an air of excitement and belonging--truly a great representation of Midwest hospitality and big-city vibe!"
1517,"Swissotel is located in a great location; we walked most places we wanted to go (Aquarium, Field Museum, Symphony, etc.). The view was great even without upgrading to lake or river view room (recommend the south side rooms). The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on in a hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
1518,"Last year we had our Holiday Party at this place. I directed our staff to book this place as we worked closer, and actually we were involved partly in the design of the hotel and the Wacker Drive in front of it. We booked over 50 rooms i believe. We stayed there for the party, but unfortunately i had to leave at 5:00 am next morning for a business trip to Washington DC. I was fortunate though to be awarded a gift card from our holiday party committee for a single night stay at the hotel, so i could enjoy the views. It expires at the end of January. I went online to see if the hotel is booked up and has no room for the holiday, and found out that there are plenty of rooms available through TripAdvisor, Booking etc. Even 25% discounts are offered for the day.  Unfortunately, the"
1519,"I was treated as if I didn't belong at this hotel, when I'd actually had 3 nights reserved at the hotel. The staff acted as if they didn't want to service me, and treated me like a lowerclass citizen. For the reaminder of my stay, I avoided the staff and any needed assistance. I was staying there for a conference or I would've found another place to stay. I can't believe I was treated like I was here. "
1520,"We recently stayed at Talbott for our wedding. We initially had a wedding block set up, but COVID changed everything. However, Talbott was extremely accommodating and understanding from beginning to end. The level of communication and response time was great and helped lower the stress level while planning our wedding. My wife used the McRae Room to get ready with her bridesmaids and everything was perfect for them. Highly recommend the Talbott for your wedding block or stay!!"
1521,"This hotel is located in the heart of Chicago and the location is really good. Room is fairly good too. However, during pandemic, the hotel doesn't allow you to enjoy all the amenities you might expect. So just reconsider your visit. "
1522,"We recently stayed at the wonderful Talbott Hotel and though it is not the same missing Perry and all the employees who always went above and beyond for us, the minimum staff there were very accomodating, friendly and whatever we needed was available in a short time. (Even a microwave delivered to the room!) The location also can not be beat as it is close to wonderful restaurants and shopping in the Gold Coast.  I much prefer this location to the busy streets south by the river. They did a great job maintaining distance and followed all covid precautions.  Thank you and we can not wait to return and see you ALL again soon!"
1523,"Good value for money. Location was perfect! The staff were kind and handled a situation I had prior to check-out without any hesitation or questioning. The hotel room was average, no bells or whistles but comfortable--particularly the bed. I will return for a later stay."
1524,We thoroughly enjoyed another trip to Chicago and our stay at the Talbott was again top notch. Dwayne is like an old friend so fun to talk to and truly cares about his guests helping out however he can.
1525,"This is the perfect choice for your stay in Chicago. The central location is convenient to the best restaurants, shopping and lake front. We found our room to be very comfortable and tastefully appointed. Everything was clean and we felt very safe. I would especially like to thank the manager Chris for making our stay so enjoyable. His hospitality and local recommendations made our weekend!"
1526,"This was a beautiful, clean, and safe property with super helpful and friendly staff.  i loved how they had tight COVID precautions.  i never felt unsafe here.  It was also in a very convenient location.  I will return!"
1527,"Restaurant, valet, and minibar currently closed due to covid 19. But room was well cleaned on arrival, hotel is in central downtown location with great restaurants and shops within minutes of hotel. Minibar items are available for purchase in the lobby and hotel is very quiet. Have zero complaints about hotel"
1528,An oasis of calm amid the Downtown Chicago buzz. A perfect location for visiting the city with top notch customer service. Thankyou Chris for all your great info and personal assistance . This was our second stay at the Talbott and it’s the extra mile customer service along with great value that keeps us coming back .
1529,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Talbott Hotel! We were thrilled to discover they’re pet friendly and we brought our dog, Millie, along for the trip. The accommodations were excellent. We were greeted with a welcome kit including masks and hand sanitizers for each of us. The hotel was very clean and all staff were taking the appropriate precautions. Everyone was very friendly and they were able to accommodate our request for early check-in and late check-out. Parking was close by. If you live in driving distance to Chicago I would definitely recommend driving in and bringing your pup! The Talbott is so close to many dog friendly shops and restaurants including Nico’s, Tavern on Rush, and Lou Malnati’s! Even the Shoreline Sight seeing tour welcomed Millie. We will definitely"
1530,"I arrived to Chicago last Thursday. I had booked my reservation via expedia. When I go to my reservation, I had noticed it was cancelled. I called the Talbott and was advised that, they never cancel third party reservations, but that someone from their company cancelled my reservation and there are no notes stating why, so it is most likely a mistake on their part.   With that being said, I ask, So.. what happens now, I made this reservation weeks in advance. Their response was, well the hotel was completely booked and they cannot accommodate us. This was my first time in Chicago its late a night and I am basically told to figure it out, as if it was my fault.   I will never again attempt to book with this hotel. Their customer service and addressing customer concerns is"
1531,"Pros:  Location-on the Gold Coast near Water Tower and Oak Street Price- found a great AAA deal Responsive Staff  Cons: Nothing about this is a Hyatt. Had no curling iron, mouthwash, coffee maker, and other basics available to guests. It’s actually noisier here than staying in Streeterville with ambulances. No desk to do work or set your laptop on.  This isn’t all about covid either. Expect though to have no access to an onsite restaurant. The fitness center is sign up only for 45 minutes at a time. No valet parking so you’re going to need to find a place yourself. And no room service- so similar to other places we requested our daily supplies, changed our own sheets, threw out linens and collected our garbage daily.  What I think is wrong is we are charged a nightly “urban"
1532,"I have booked The Talbott hotel after doing many reviews and comparisons. The room I booked was a 2 queen beds as and it was massive, I am sure it is very difficult to find such size in mid-Chicago. The location is central with many things to do nearby, within 10-15 mins walking. The lift is a bit slow but no big deal. Will definitely consider staying there again if in central Chicago"
1533,"Great, central location meaning you can walk to so many places of interest if you choose to. The Hotel is quaint with a convenient restaurant and lounge on the ground floor where reception is also found although initially it is difficult to find. We found all 3 employees who manned the help desk went the extra mile."
1534,We’ve stayed at other hotels for twice the price around the same area and found this one to outshine them all. Where old world charm meets modern design aesthetics! Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Will stay here for our future business trips. Staff was very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is only a block couple of blocks west of shops of North Michigan Avenue and walkable to excellent restaurants in the area! Very pleased! Thank you 
1535,"Everything was perfect. However, the room size was a little too small for me to be comfortable. The check-in was very proper and communication was passed down the proper channels because I had a unique problem when checking in. "
1536,"Great boutique hotel, can walk to Michigan Avenue.  Wonderful staff everywhere.  The bar/restaurant was excellent. The bartenders Mark and D so nice.  The best little burgers at happy hour. My room was small bot cozy. Will definitely go back!"
1537,"Nice hotel, located well. Know that the junior suites are near elevators, and the studio suites are over the back which has beeping trucks in the pre-dawn hours. Apart from that, the hotel is clean and handsome, and has character. The rooms are quiet if you get the right location."
1538,"Very Good Stay, Very Big Rooms, Clean, however, we had 2 rooms and the TV in our Daughters room did not work. 2nd problem was not really the hotels fault, but impacted our stay.  We had a Man and Woman next door that were very loud, and you could hear them well down the hallway, if you get my meaning.  "
1539,"We have stayed here a couple of times and will be back for sure.  The location is walking distance to most downtown favorites.  The hotel is clean, the staff is nice & it is very affordable. You can’t beat the quality/price/location!"
1540,"The staff at the Talbot Hotel was friendly and attentive. The food and ambiance in the bar was top notch. The room was clean, nicely appointed and had an excellent TV. I’ll be back! The location is within easy walking distance to many of the highlights Chicago."
1541,Great visit to Chicago and The Talbott was fabulous ! The stay was very comfortable ...walking distance to great food and shopping on Michigan Ave!   The staff was so kind hospitable.  Will definitely be back ❤️
1542,"My friend and I had a wonderful experience at the Talbott hotel from the moment we stepped inside. We were greeted by Dwayne, who has the best hospitality we could've asked for. He helped us to our room and immediately saw that we wanted a better view. Dwayne called to the front desk and was able to get our room changed with a much better view! Finally, before Dwayne left he gave us several spots to try in Chicago that were delicious fun and affordable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
1543,We were here with a large group for a competition.  The hotel did an excellent job accommodating us and is beautiful with a great atmosphere.  The staff went way above and beyond to take care of anything we needed which made life so nice and we could focus on the kids and their competition.  Special shout out to DeWayne and Charles at the front door who were FABULOUS as well as Angie in housekeeping.  She was happy to track down anything we needed.  Highly recommend this hotel.
1544,"Our children were in town for a color guard competition and the entire staff was amazing all weekend long.   Charles, Dwayne and Angie were very supportive of our groups needs and they welcomed us like we were family.   The people working there are the true gem to this hotel!   They were very accommodating to our large group of 30+.    I have future visits planned to the Chicago area and this will now be my go to place!   Job well done!  From the bottom of our hearts thank you staff for making this a memorable experience!"
1545,"Traveling with a large group for color guard competition and had a great experience! Dwayne, Charles, and Angie were all amazing! All hotel staff were very nice and helpful. 35+ people in our group and no complaints!"
1546,"Totally unexpected, Such a beautiful room and hotel for a last minute booking. The pricing was also very affordable. Even came with two complimentary bottles of wine. Amazing; needed, and booking again soon.  "
1547,"Priceline chose this place for us and honestly I wish I wouldve gone with my original choice. The price was only a couple dollars cheaper than the hotels that had pools and jacuzzis and water,coffee and tea that we didn't have to pay for. Valet was 70$ for one night..jeez... the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. There was no option for late check out.  It just was very basic and for 10/20 $ more we couldve stayed in a better place.  The bathroom was nice, that's about it."
1548,"I was very impressed with the cleanliness, comfort, and customer service at the Talbott! The check in experience was wonderful and I even got a complimentary drink voucher. My room was beautiful, light and airy, and the bed was comfortable which is very important to me. The bathroom was gorgeous and immaculate. I’ve stayed at many hotels downtown Chicago and this is my new favorite! I will definitely be staying again and I can’t wait! "
1549,"Always try to stay in a different area of Chicago so thought we would try a bit further north than Magnificent Mike. Loved the neighborhood with local restaurants and great architecture like the Driehaus Museum. The staff was excellent, gracious and very helpful and very good, well-informed concierges.  And the restaurant had excellent food.  Only negative was longer waits for elevators but it is an older building so we just built in a few extra minutes.  Room wise, the studio king was huge with nicely upholstered sofa. Anyone with noise intolerance may want to ask for 8th floor or higher by phone directly to the hotel in advance since there is new condo bldg next door with huge HVAC exhausts up to 7th floor.  This is really a great value for the money!"
1550,"It is NOT ACCEPTABLE to charge fees with NO DISCLOSURE.  I got a $17 charge plus taxes for an ""URBAN AMENITIES FEE"" total of almost $20 for one night stay.  It should be included in the total price and not slid in on the back end when it's too late.  When I questioned the person behind the desk and told her I was not made aware, the answer was lame.  ""it's automatic and just included as a standard"""
1551,"This boutique style hotel is situated in the gold coast area with many options to shop and eat in the area. The hotel is awesome, clean, with friendly staff and nice bar to unwind. There is also a gym."
1552,"Everything was amazing about our stay at the Talbott Hotel.  The door men was beyond helpful, telling us the cheap places to park our car (instead of valet at the hotel), local restaurants and a place to go for groceries within walking distance.    For a boutique hotel, the room was double the size that was expected.  We just had a normal double queen room, but there was so much extra room, and a seating area.  Everything was clean, the bathroom was also nice sized, and they had large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion.  It was nice not to have to try to squeeze out a few drops of shampoo of a small travel size bottle, just to wash my long hair, and since there were three girls in the room, we didn't have to ask for more.  Plus that, the conditioner was quite"
1553,"Great location.  Rooms are nice.  Cozy little bar/restaurant.  If you don't like the feel or a big, convention type hotel, this is for you.   Dwayne at the the front door is very helpful and friendly.  Check in was quick, and friendly."
1554,"All of the staff makes an effort to be very welcoming and helpful. The concierge left a welcome note for our son, a nice touch that was unnecessary but appreciated. The stay had multiple moments like that.   This is a great location, good access to various modes of transportation and walkable access a wide range of food styles and price points.   This is an older building that has been updated and well appointed without losing the historic feel. The elephant in the room, so to speak, is the elevators. Nice and cozy. But plan for extra travel time during prime check-in/out time."
1555,"We appreciated the upgrade to a larger room, and the bowl of fruit which welcomed us.  We were in town for a special event.  The event organizers had made arrangements with the hotel to be the recommended place to stay for delegates. The front staff were always welcoming and friendly.  The bar staff less so.  We had problems with the shower plumbing, but since we did not complain, nothing was done about it.   The hotel is well located with respect to shopping."
1556,"First off it is in a BEAUTIFUL neighborhood, we were greeted at the door by 2 doormen, they helped with our luggage, as soon as we walked in the door the concierge was right at the door and said “it’s the birthday princess we have been waiting for you all morning!” My mom and I looked at each other and couldn’t believe what an awesome welcome. When I booked the hotel in the notes I wrote that we were celebrating my daughters 9th birthday and this is going to be her first time in Chicago and we were going to the American girl store. A few days after booking the hotel they wrote an email asking her name because they would like to have a personal birthday card for her and an amenities. When I read it I thought how amazing! I believe the concierges name was Roanna (spelling ?) her"
1557,This is a very nice hotel. It is in the heart of downtown Chicago. It is an older hotel that has been remodeled very nicely! You will be greeted as soon as you pull up. The check in process was seamless. Concierge was helpful. if you drive be prepared a hefty price to park($65 a day). Definitely an upscale hotel! 
1558,"Great boutique hotel in the Gold Coast area. Many stores, banks, and restaurants nearby. Something for everyone. I have stayed here before and will again. Rooms and bathrooms  are spacious and exceptionally clean,"
1559,"The Talbott is a boutique hotel that has been restored, yet still has the 1920's feel and vibe.  The rooms are upscale, comfortable, spacious.  The staff were beyond nice and accomodating.  It is in the heart of downtown, walking distance to just about everything!  Great bar and restaurant.  We would definitely stay there again!  The Concierge was very knowledgeable and informative.  Also, a shout out to Perry, who handled our luggage and MANY other things.  He is the man to go to if you want info. on Chicago!  He could not have been more courteous, genuinely caring and helpful."
1560,"Great service. Great room. Phenomenal location. We over-payed because we stayed here for Valentines Day, and that same weekend Chicago was hosting the NBA All-Star game. So rates were through the roof. But, that being said, the stay was well worth it and I will definitely be coming back and would prefer to only ever stay here for my return trips to Chicago."
1561,"We had a wonderful long weekend in the Windy City.  The hotel’s location was perfect for our shopping trips and we had numerous restaurants within walking distance,  the breakfast served at the hotel was delicious.  The entire staff was helpful and courteous.  The housekeeping staff was excellent, especially Rosemary Miller. She went out of her way to help make our stay comfortable. We will be back!"
1562,The hotel was awesome. The room was spacious and clean.  The location was convenient to Michigan Avenue shopping and restaurants.  The staff was friendly and the housekeeping staff - Rosemary Miller - was exceptional. Breakfast was delicious each morning. This will be our place to stay in Chicago for the future.

1564,"Comfortable Bed and extremely large Room with  a 70 inch television ... .  The Staff was remarkably polite and helpful,  from housekeeping to the Concierge to the Bartender.....  If you are traveling to Chicago and plan on visiting  Rush street or the Mag Mile  this is a great choice ."
1565,"Clean, pleasant room.  Cozy restaurant.  Housekeeping super nice. Could have used more chairs in suite.  Very convenient location: close to entertainment, restaurants, and shopping.   Windows blocked noise from street."
1566,"Wonderful 5 night stay!  Staff was excellent, room was not overly huge but very clean and modern. Fully stocked fridge was a treat! Restaurant was great and open until late!  Right around the corner from Michigan Ave ;) Would definitely stay here again!!"
1567,This hotel greatly exceeded our expectations. We booked last minute through hotels tonight app and it will now be our regular place to stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay! I believe my husband called back to get details on the bedding and comforter because it was amazing!
1568,Rooms are compact but comfortable.  All you need for a stay in the city! Quiet Street  Great Sleep  Great Shower. Wonderful Staff- especially the Concierge and Bar Manager.  Went above and beyond for me. Very convenient to Michigan Ave and within a nice long walk to Millennium Park and great Museums
1569,The location was literally in the perfect area to suit my needs. Shops and restaurants everywhere. The room was clean and comfortable. I was able to check in early with no hesitation. I've never stayed at a hotel that offered a complimentary drink for a stay and the food was delicious. I have already recommended the hotel to people as well as 20 East. 
1570,"outstanding trip for momma and me.  Great location just off the Mile, and a wonderful quaint little neighborhood.  Staff was courteous and our room was big and comfortable.  Food and ambiance at 20E was excellent."
1571,"We visited Chicago to return our daughter to school for the semester and lucked into this gem of a hotel. The staff was fantastic, always friendly and welcoming. The check-in process was quick and smooth and the accommodations were second to none - comfy beds and a really spacious room. This quaint hotel is within a quick walk to Water Tower Place so it’d be a fantastic choice for shoppers looking to browse the Magnificent Mile. I heartily recommend this establishment and we will certainly be returning!"
1572,"Super friendly stuff, perfect and super clean rooms and the hotel is located at one of the best spots in Chicago.You can reach shopping miles by walk and also a lot of restaurants are near by. Next time i will definetly stay again at the Talbott hotel."
1573,"My room was an absolute dream - the room was spacious and quiet with beautiful views of Chicago. Emily at the front desk was incredibly welcoming and Gene was very helpful in answering my questions and giving recommendations. The hotel is in such a prime location, with great shopping and restaurants nearby - and Michigan Avenue is just steps away! I will definitely be staying at the Talbott again the next time I'm in Chicago."
1574,"My wife and I stayed at The Talbott last March and we were impressed enough that we stayed there again this past weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay because of: 1) the incredible friendliness and helpfulness of all employees at the hotel; 2) the cleanliness of our room and its comfort; and, 3) the very reasonable rate, especially for a fantastic location in Chicago."
1575,Staff was awesome. Everyone at the Hotel is super friendly and willing to help if needed. Great location to everything Chicago has to offer. Overnight rooms are very large and comfortable . Food and Beverage at 20E was exceptional. 
1576,Concierge was amazing made my daughters birthday extra special. Placed chocolate covered strawberries In room while we were being tourists. An amazing surprise...... Would definitely recommend this to friends and family 
1577,"We came in to see a show at the Ruth Page theatre. I picked the Talbot because of the online pictures, location, and price. We had a fantastic weekend stay there. Besides the staff being so nice and friendly, it is a beautiful building, the room was very comfortable with a great bed. We both woke up and almost at the same time said how great we slept. Go there, you'll be happy!"
1578,"This place was great!!! The staff was so friendly, and helpful I felt like I was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel. The Lobby lounge was wonderful with a great menu and wine list. The hotel and rooms were clean and fully stocked with all we needed. The hotel lends itself to old-world charm, in its fixtures and furnishings. Our Concierge Gene was FANTASTIC really nice and very helpful. He got us last minute tickets to a show and we were so appreciative. I forget the name of the door man, he was tall and mature with the best smile and helpful attitude. Thank you all!!! We will be back!!!"
1579,"The room was clean and well stocked, hallways are well lit, and the elevators were quick. The restaurant and bar area was cozy and there are plenty of lounge areas in the lobby. Third visit and all trips have been consistently great."
1580,Had a great stay at The Talbott for the weekend. Nice suite. Great little bar and wonderful breakfast. Conveniently located. The hotel lobby and the rooms were very clean and quiet with a friendly and competent staff.
1581,"I recently did a staycation in Chicago just to get away for the evening. I found The Talbott hotel via my hot wire deal. After reading some reviews and checking out some pictures I was excited to stay here. Upon arrival the doorman, Dwayne, greeted us with the biggest smile and hello! We walked right to the check in counter and was met by Joshua who went ABOVE AND BEYOND. Not only was he so kind, but we also got a room upgrade AND 2 complimentary drink tickets to their lobby bar. How amazing! I was so impressed and I had not even seen the room yet in person lol. The room itself was spacious, the view wasn’t anything since we were ok between building, but that didn’t bother me. The bathroom was nice and the shower was HUGE. About 4 people could fit in there, no joke. My favorite"
1582,"The hotel location is great for downtown Chicago, but you will have an ""urban facility fee"" of $15 a night added to your bill, not shown in the Hotels.com price. A Snickers Bar fro the snack draw was $5."
1583,Our stay at The Talbott was incredible. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. They make your stay worth your while. Loved it!! Will definitely stay here again when we visit Chicago in the future.
1584,"Came back to the Talbott with fond memories from past visits. Unfortunately several changes will make me reconsider coming back. Not sure if they are having financial difficulties-but nickel and diming the customer is NOT creating returning visitors. Vallet Parking-$70.00,  No coffee machine in room- have to go to the lobby to get your morning Joe, no free mini toiletries. I absolutely can bring my own if I would have known.  You will find larger bottles of shampoo, lotions, soap for $15.00 per bottle.  And finally- think twice if you want that after dinner cocktail-One beer and one short white Russian will cost you 20.00 plus tip!! Ouch!  Now all this being said- the staff was just as nice as they were the last time we were here. Both the night and day bellman are true"
1585,My family has been going to The Talbott Hotel for the last 15 years.  Our main reason for staying there is the service and hospitality Given to us by Gene Murray.  Gene anticipates our every need and recommends new restaurants he thinks we would enjoy and he always nails it. Now that are kids married they also choose to stay at the Talbott because of Gene.  The Talbott Hotel is very fortunate to have Gene working for them for so long!   KG
1586,Gene Murray was absolutely wonderful!!!  He went above and beyond to make our stay at the Talbott the most memorable experience for my family and me.  We came in for wedding dress shopping and bridesmaid dresses and this trip will never be forgotten thanks to Gene and all of his accommodations he made for us!!   I always look forward staying at the Talbott because we get to see Gene!
1587,Everytime we come to Chicago we pick the Talbott for their fabulous concierge Gene. He always goes above and beyond to make our visits special and memorable. We had another wonderful weekend and he had awesome recommendations for us.
1588,Hotel was Clean. Charles the Doorman was kind and caring. Sweet Man. Check in was easy and people were nice. Rooms were clean. Beds very comfortable. Bathrooms clean and good smelling shampoo and conditioner and cream. We really enjoyed our stay.  
1589,Stayed here for a few days. The room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were also nice and helpful. There is quick room service and complementary cup of coffee in the morning. Would stay here again.  
1590,My stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was fabulous because of Perry he took wonderful care of us in every way. Great customer service and room service etc he's one of a kind and hard to find. Myself and our family will be returning there in the near future
1591,"I like this hotel so much. Traditional and creative design. Morning coffee is free,delicious.  Around here,downtown is very nice. I suggest you to go walk around with Digital Camera. There are some shops that you can eat breakfast at early morning(like Starbacks,Yolk.)"
1592,"My wife and I have stayed at The Talbot on our last 6 trips to Chicago. With many options, we continue to return this very special hotel. All of the staff is exceptional. We highly recommend the Talbot. "
1593,"I recently stayed at the Talbott due to being a Hyatt member.  I was immediately unhappy with the room set up due to no desk for work.  The chairs were crush velvet and old reciprocals in the room.   The bathroom was gorgeous and updated.  No coffee pot in the rooms, no coffee in the hotel till after 6:30 a.m.  I like to have coffee in my room in the morning or the opportunity to order coffee from room service.  I was told by the front desk that room service didn't serve till am.   I was told I could walk to Starbucks down the street.  NOT accommodating at all!  Was informed later that I could have requested coffee and a pot, although that wasn't offered to me when I called at 5 am.  I WILL NOT be returning to the Talbott!"
1594,"The Talbott has the best staff I’ve encountered anywhere!  Dwayne, Charles, concierge, front desk, housekeeping, and manager are so helpful, accommodating, and they genuinely want to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  This visit was a girls weekend.  Our stay was fabulous as usual and I keep returning to this hotel due to the welcoming caring staff, plus excellent location!"
1595,"Very Hotel. Not thrilled with the remodeling of the rooms. Climate control in the room was very inconsistent. Great location. It is very close to many restaurants, shops, etc. The service was very good. However, the noise from hallways and other rooms can be easily heard."
1596,"I used to live in Chicago, so love that when I get to visit for work, I found such a great spot! The hotel is absolutely lovely, the bed incredibly comfortable, the rooms beautiful, the staff wonderful, and the food delicious! "
1597,"We stayed for a few days over the Holidays.  It is the perfect spot and in the center of everything- shopping, restaurants, and much more.  I have stayed at many Chicago hotels and I will only stay here from now on!"
1598,"The Talbott Hotel is the place to stay while visiting Chicago! It’s in the center of everything, shopping 🛍, great food 🥘 and all the beauty Chicago has to offer! Very clean 🧽 and accommodating! I will definitely stay here again!"
1599,"My partner and I were looking forward to visiting Chicago in December 2019 after booking the flight almost a year before in January. All I can say is from the first day to the last, our stay was nothing short of perfect. The location of the hotel is fantastic. A 2 minute walk to Michigan Avenue where all of the shops are with plenty of bars, restaurants and tourist attractions too close by too. Upon arrival we were treated to an upgrade to a Junior Suite. The room was spacious and the king bed was so comfortable. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the bartender Mark was a pleasure to talk to and knew his way around a cocktail. A special mention goes out to two of the doormen. Perry and Patrick were so helpful and couldn’t do enough for us. They helped with"
